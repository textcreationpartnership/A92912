            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE ſhall not ſtand much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Interpretation of the word <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> becauſe it is diſputable whether it be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Greeks, or from the Arabians or Egyptians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paracelſus</hi> &amp; other modern
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:171520:7"/>Phyſitians called it <hi>Spagery</hi> from the Greek words that ſignifies to pull in pieces or divide, and alſo to unite or joyn together, as being an Art to <hi>diſſolve and Unite again any natural bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some proudly call this Art <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and they who ſtudy the Philoſophers-ſtone, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the only true Philoſophers, and Philoſophers Sons; of which ſee the Book called <hi>Turba Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is called from <hi>Hermes</hi> or <hi>Mercury</hi> the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick Art,</hi> and thence come the Hermetical veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and ſeals, of which hereafter.</p>
               <p>It is alſo called <hi>the Separating</hi> and <hi>Diſtilling Art.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the diſtinction of Diſciplines is from the end, and that of Chymiſtry is not onely to melt Metals, and ſeparate one Mettle from another, but a hope to turn inferior Metals into Gold. And by uſe and operation, they ſtill diſcovered new things, and ſo came to diſtil and ſeparate Vegetables. So the whole Art of Chymiſtry conſiſts in working of Metals, and preparing of Medicines. But they are by cuſtom called only the true Chymiſts, that labour to turn the cheap Metals into Gold and Silver, or that make good Medicines of Minerals or Vegetables, or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; and the inferior Metal-workers are not honored with this Name of a Chymiſt.</p>
               <p>Nor doth a Chymiſt only exerciſe in Natural bodies, as an Apothecary, but he diſſolves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded bodies into their firſt principles, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates them, the good from the bad, clenſeth all, alters, perfects, and exalts them, and makes them efficacious; and if need be, he again joyns them together, as when the ſtrength of the whole compounded body is required.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:171520:7"/>
               <p>Hence there are two ends in Chymiſtry, the internal and external. The internal end is that, whoſe work being perfect the operation ceaſeth: and to diſſolve bodies into their firſt principles, <hi>to clenſe, alter, exalt, and purifie them in particular together, and make them fit for uſe, is very neceſſary.</hi> In reſpect of this end, Chymiſtry of it ſelf is an Art ſeparate from Phyſick, becauſe it doth not only ſerve the Phyſitian, but other Artiſts.</p>
               <p>This end hath two parts, for the Chymiſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only labors in tranſmuting of Metals, or ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Phyſick. If the later, the Apothecary and the Chymiſt are little different; now the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian uſeth the Apotehcary as a Servant therefore he ought to be skilled in Chymical operations, to direct his Apothecary: and when the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian himſelf prepares Chymical medicines, he is a Chymiſt, as when he cures wounds and diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, he is a Chirurgion.</p>
               <p>The external end of Chymiſtry is twofold, it is either exerciſed in tranſmutation of Metals, or to cure mans body. In reſpect of the firſt end, it is a diſtinct Art from all others, and therefore it is called by way of eminency Alchymy, or the Art of the great Magiſtral, the Magiſtery of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Art of <hi>Hermes.</hi> In reſpect of the latter end, Chymiſtry is not a peculiar Art, but belongs to Phyſick, and is the perfection of it, for it is the part only of the Phyſitian to uſe and apply Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical medicines for cure, and may be called then a Chymical Phyſitian, and the Medicines Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical, which are the perfection of Phyſick.</p>
               <p>Some will have no difference between com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Medicine or Phyſick and Chymiſtry, and ſay that the old Phyſitians &amp; Apothecaries knew all the Chymical preparations, as <hi>Digeſtion, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171520:8"/>Diſtillation, Calcination, Reverberation, Extraction, and the like.</hi> We confeſs they knew ſome of them,
<note place="margin">7. <hi>De comp. med. ſec. ge. c.</hi> 11.</note> for <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth to make me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines by long ſteeping. And Treacle is not good till it be ſermented long, but they knew it not ſo wel as it is now known; &amp; what they had was from the Refiners,
<note place="margin">Lib. de ſimp. med. facul.</note> as <hi>Galen</hi> ſhews, and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry was not then brought into the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhops and Phyſitians houſe from the Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners furnace and Chymical work-houſes.</p>
               <p>Some enlarge Chymiſtry, and diſpute princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and labour to bring in new operations into all the parts of Philoſophy and Phyſick, but it is not for Chymiſts, as ſuch, to diſpute of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but for Phyſitians and Philoſophers And Chymiſtry doth but only bring ſome obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and experiments by working, from which the Phyſitian and Philoſopher makes conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>Therefore a Chymiſt is exerciſed about all natural bodies, to diſſolve, purifie, and work them as to his internal end. But as to his exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal end, he is converſant only about Metals, to tranſmute them. In reſpect of the latter end, he is converſant, not only in Metals, but all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bodies that may be medicinable, whether Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables or Animals.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Chymiſtry is an art, that is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſant about natural things to know them only, but to make ſomthing out of them. And though it hath its principles and concluſions, yet is it not a ſcience, <hi>but an Art or factive habit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to reaſon.</hi> Therefore Chymiſtry is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a part of Phyſick, nor ſubordinate unto it, though it be converſant about the natural body, as Phyſick is, becauſe the manner of ordering is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:171520:8"/>divers from Phyſick, for skill only in operation or working, neither makes a Philoſopher nor a Phyſitian, but every fool may attain to operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if he have but a good purſe.</p>
               <p>From hence we give this Definition of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry. <hi>It is an Art to reſolve Natural compound bodies into their Principles of which they are made, and to make them pure and ſtrong for Medicines, or to perfect or change Metals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the Sophiſtical operations to make baſe Metals like gold or ſilver in colour, are not worthy of the honeſt name of Chymiſtry, though the Chymiſt may for tryal, do ſomthing therein to obtain a higher end.</p>

               <head>Chap. 2. <hi>Of the Truth and Dignity of Chymiſtry.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is commendable; firſt from the tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Metals: ſecondly from the good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines that are found out by it. That Metals are tranſmuted, it is proved by experience. In <hi>Hungary</hi> by the Town called <hi>Smolnitium,</hi> in the Mountain <hi>Carpath,</hi> there are Fountains into which if iron be caſt, it is turned into the beſt copper. The ſame is done at <hi>Goſſaria;</hi> and the ſame may be done by Art, for if Iron be caſt into Vitriol-water, there is a red pouder that ſticks to it, which being mleted, turns to cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Alſo Quickſilver is turned to Lead, as <hi>John Rhenan</hi> ſhews in his Definition for the truth of Chymiſtry: although <hi>Nicolas Guibert</hi> Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of <hi>Lotharing</hi> thinks otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>But the chief queſtion is concerning turning of other Metals into gold, which though it ſeems
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:171520:9"/>impoſſible to many, yet experience is again, them not to ſpeak of the Ancients <hi>Arnold de vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la nova</hi> and <hi>Raymund, Lully,</hi> and others. Such things have been done in the memory of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and of our ſelves, and it is impudency to deny ſuch a certain Experiment.</p>
               <p>The chief objection is, that Metals are diſtinct in ſpecie, and cannot be tranſmuted one into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, unleſs you can make a Pig of a Dog. But I anſwer, That the form of Iron, and the form of Lead cannot be turned into the forms of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or gold, but the form of iron departing, the form of copper may be brought in, and the form of Lead departing, the form of gold may be brought in; and this is eaſier in Metals, becauſe they have one common matter: the Elements are tranſinuted; Wheat and other Plants are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſpecies in their forms, yet they are turned into chyle, and blood is turned into fleſh, bones, and membranes</p>
               <p>Nor let it ſeem abſurd, that Metals in ſo ſhort a time can be turned into gold, except you are ignorant of the power of Spirits, and of Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal operations; what force hath thunder upon Metals? What force hath Aqua fortis and other Spirits?</p>
               <p>Nor let any ſay that Chymical gold is not true gold, but apparent, for the forms of things being hid from us, we know them by their proper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and proprieties; but Chymical gold hath all the proprieties of gold: therefore it muſt be acknowledged to be true gold. The proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of gold are, that it be yellow, not ringing, malleable, ſo that one ounce beaten, may cover ten acres of ground; and the third part of a grain may be drawn into wyer of 134. foot long, as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:171520:9"/>
                  <hi>Cardan</hi> writes:
<note place="margin">Lib. de varietate rerum. De vanit. ſcient.</note> to be incorruptible in air and water, and to endure all teſts by the aſſay-men.</p>
               <p>Some, with <hi>Agrippa,</hi> ſay that the Chymiſts draw a tincture of gold, which they give to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Metals, and make them gold, but onely ſo much as that was from which the tincture was drawn, and ſo there is no profit. But experience ſhews the contrary, for <hi>Edward Kelley</hi> an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman at <hi>Prague,</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Thaddaeus Haggecius,</hi> turned a pound of Quickſilver into gold with one drop of a very red liquor; and it is ſtil to be ſeen, and the ſign of the liquor ſticks like a Rubie upon the Quickſilver ſo turned to gold, and as much more gold may be made of the ſame: let this one experiment ſerve turn: Yet though this art be true, it is very difficult, as appears by the loſt labors of many; and none can eaſily attain to it by reading or practiſe.</p>
               <p>There are many cheaters. But let none truſt him that promiſeth this art for money. Firſt let them make gold for themſelves, which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly want. I ſhall recite ſome of their cheats. Firſt they carry gold or ſilver in a ſtick, with which they ſtir their Metals. Others diſſolve gold or ſilver in Aqua fortis, and mix with Ink, and write upon paper, in which they put the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal they pretend to turn. Or they uſe the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of gold or ſilver, as ſand upon a letter. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mix gold or ſilver diſſolved, within char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole. Others have falſe bottoms to their cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, into which they put gold. Others have fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led great coles with gold, and laid them upon the crucible. But the greateſt cheat is, when they have gotten ſome of the true tincture, and done wonders till they have gotten money, but can go no further being ignorant.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:171520:10"/>
               <p>The other end of Chymiſtry is for Phyſitians, for firſt the medicines Nature afford us, have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten parts of divers ſtrength and force; but by Chymiſtry they are ingeniouſly ſeparated. The Chymiſts imitate the induſtry of the Ancients in preparing of meats, by boyling, and other prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to make them pleaſant and wholſom. And the Ancients, when the patient wanted much nouriſhment, and could not well concoct, found out conſummate broath or culleſſes, in which the unprofitable parts for nouriſhment were caſt away, and that which nouriſhed beſt was preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Thus are Chymical medicines made power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, pleaſant and ſafe, and the Phyſitian may cure by them ſafely quickly and pleaſantly. For when the thick earth, and unprofitable parts are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the profitable and ſpirital, the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner parts ſooner pierce into the whole body, and exerciſe their force.</p>
               <p>And being given in a ſmall doſe, and freed from unpleaſant qualities, they are taken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loathing, and ſo work the better. And ſome medicines that are rank poyſon, are prepared by the Chymiſt, and made ſafe. Nature is the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts leader, which makes us wholſom, Spaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waters from Minerals and Metals, by which deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate diſeaſes are cured.</p>
               <p>But obſerve, that we here only commend the true Chymiſtry, but hate the falſe Chymiſts, who when they can prepare a medicine or two, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe golden mountains, and ſcorn all the Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, when they themſelves are ignorant in all good Arts, chiefly in Phyſick and Philoſophy. And will be called by no other name then Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mecial Phyſitians; when they may be more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Haeretical Phyſitians.</p>

               <p>CHymiſtry had been no worſe, if it had been found out later; for that is old enough that is good enough, and there is nothing which was not new at the firſt.</p>
               <p>Some ſuppoſe that all the Chymical Books were written but three or four ages ſince: but they are out, for we have Greek Authors that treat of it. Some ſhew that Chymiſtry may be proved ancient, ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> invented it,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.</note> but this they cannot prove.</p>
               <p>But the Rudiments of Chymiſtry were more probably invented by <hi>Tubalcain</hi> the Maſter of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron and Braſs. And if he ſhewed how to faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Metals, he muſt needs know how to find them out, melt and ſeparate them, and purifie them. The Scriptures commend him for an excellent Metal-man, and his Succeſſors were iuduſtrious in the ſame. And if they knew how to work on Iron and Braſs, they queſtionleſs knew how to order Metals</p>
               <p>After the flood, the invention or propagation of Chymiſtry was by many imputed to <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus,</hi> and from him it is at this day called the Hermetical Art, the veſſels and ſeals of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi> are ſo called from him. And he was called <hi>Treſmegiſtus</hi> or thrice great, becauſe he was the chief Prieſt, Philoſopher, and King, or (as others ſay) the chief King, Prieſt, and Prophet. He lived in ancient time, about the 2000d year of the World heard <hi>Noah</hi> preach, and was (as the Learned ſay) the Maſter of <hi>Chamephis</hi> or <hi>Chuſus.</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:171520:11"/>The Grecians as well as the Aegyptians, hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him for antiquity and learning, and imputed the invention of all Arts and Sciences to him. They ſay he wrote 25000. Books all ſet forth in his Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meſue</hi> mentions another, <hi>Hermes</hi> that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, and mentions a <hi>Hiera</hi> of <hi>Hermes,</hi> and Pills of <hi>Alhandal</hi> of <hi>Hermes,</hi> and ſo do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Phyſitians; but theſe vulgar medicines were not worth of the Name of <hi>Hermes Triſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is alſo a <hi>Smaragd Table</hi> eſteemed by all Chymiſts, which was found in the Valley of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron</hi> after the flood, but the Author of it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. Some ſay it was found in the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of <hi>Triſmegiſtus,</hi> by a woman called <hi>Sarah;</hi> it is the foundation of all Chymiſtry: and I ſhal here mention it.</p>

                              <hi>To ſpeak plain truth without lying, it is moſt true and certain, that, what is below, is as that is which is above: and that which is above, is like that which is below, to perpetuate the miracles of one thing. And as all things were from one, by the meditation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of one, ſo all things are from this one thing, by adaptation or proportion. The Father of it, is the Sun, the mother the Moon, the wind carried it in its belly. The Earth is its Nurſe. This is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all Taliſm in the world. The vertue of it is compleat; if it be turned into earth, you ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the earth from the fire gently with much ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that which is ſubtile, from that which is groſs. It aſcends from earth to heaven, and deſcends again to the earth, and takes the power of things above and beneath. Thus you may have the glory of the whole
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:171520:11"/>world, and ſo all obſcurity ſhall flie from thee. This is the great force of all fortitude, becauſe it will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come every ſubtile thing, and pierce through all ſolid bodies. Thus was the world made. And from hence you may make wonderful adaptations. Therefore I am called</hi> Hermes Triſmegiſtus, <hi>becauſe I have three parts of Philoſophy of the whole world. What I have ſaid of the work of the Sun, is compleat.</hi>

Some ſay that <hi>Mary</hi> the Propheteſs Siſter of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was a Chymiſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her Name is mentioned in ſome Books that teach the making of gold; but it is an uſual thing in Chymiſts to make their Books famous by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Names of great perſons to them.</p>
               <p>Some mention the Expedition of the Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, for the antiquity of Chymiſtry. <hi>Suidas</hi> reports that the Golden Fleece which <hi>Jaſon</hi> and the Argonants brought together <hi>Medea</hi> the Daughter of King <hi>Aaetes</hi> from <hi>Cholchis,</hi> when they went into the Pontick Sea; was not ſuch a Fleece as the Poets ſeign, but a Book written in Parchement for the making of gold. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever others imagine, there is no cauſe to reject the opinion of <hi>Suidas,</hi> for all things agree unto it. The watching Dragon is <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is hard to be laid a ſleep, to this the gold which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:171520:12"/>
                  <hi>Phaſis</hi> kept in <hi>Colchis</hi> was committed This mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is put into the Temper of <hi>Mars,</hi> that is the Philoſophers furnace. The keepers thereof, are the Bulls that breath out fire, that is, heat that increaſeth by degrees. The teeth of the Dragon that go to war, and wound each other, is the fighting of the matter in the veſſel, till it be brought to unity. At length by <hi>Medeas</hi> art, the <hi>Jaſon</hi> brings the Dragon to ſleep, That is, fixeth that which would flie away, and makes a good Medicine of that which was poyſon. Now this is probable, becauſe that expoſition of a fable is beſt which agrees to truth, either in Natural or Politick things. Eſpecially becauſe the Names of <hi>Jaſon</hi> and <hi>Medea</hi> ſignifie a Phyſitian.</p>
               <p>Alſo the fable of the Apples of <hi>Heſperides</hi> is ſpoken of Chymiſtry.

                  <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſeſt of all men, wrote beyond all the Greeks and Arabians, if his Books of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things were extant, and we may affirm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abſurdity, though not clearly prove that he was a Chymiſt. It is ridiculous with ſome, to fetch Chymiſtry out of the Canticles, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the King which is the Bridgroom, to be gold, and the Queen to be ſilver, becauſe they embrace each other in Chymiſtry. And when it is ſaid, <hi>I am black, but comely,</hi> to underſtand the Crows head, which is black outwardly, and inwardly very rich. Theſe are trifles, and the Art of Chymiſtry is ſo plainly ancient, that we need not bring theſe uncertainties and lies to defend it.</p>
               <p>I like not that of <hi>Eſdras,</hi>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:171520:12"/>precious Braſs, better then common gold by the Art of Chymiſtry.</p>
               <p>Since Chriſt, Chymiſtry flouriſhed in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſo that they report all their treaſure that they maintained themſelves by againſt their enemies, was artificial Hence <hi>Diocleſian</hi> commanded all the Chymical Books for making gold in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to be burnt, leſt they ſhould grow rich thereby, and rebel again.

               <p>Therefore this <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> when Chymiſtry was not vulgarly known in the Schools, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that Medicines might better be prepared that way, began to reform Phyſick, but he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt overthrew it, together with all the Sciences. He railed at <hi>Galen</hi> &amp; <hi>Avicen,</hi> and all the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks; called the Doctors of <hi>Paris, Padua,</hi> and <hi>Monpelior,</hi> and all the Profeſſors of Phyſick, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Lyes, and ſaid they were Lyars, and not Doctors in his Writings. He burnt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Volume of <hi>Avicen,</hi> to ſhew his hatred to old Phyſick, and to incenſe his Diſciples with hatred againſt other Phyſitians. Sometimes he ſeems to avoid, being a Noveliſt, and would be accounted a Galeniſt, better then all the reſt, and to perſwade the world that the Works of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Avicen</hi> were not right, but counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Nor did he onely brag himſelf,

                  </note> but his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples cryed him up, and <hi>Crollius</hi> wrote that none was like <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and made <hi>Hermes Triſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtus</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> inferiors to him in Natural Philoſophy and Metaphyſicks. And his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wrote high commendations on his Picture and Epitaph.</p>
               <p>Hence it was,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 137.</note> that he was by many called the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:171520:13"/>Prince of Chymiſts, and none was counted a true Chymiſt, that was not a Paracelſian: but they are deceived, as <hi>Crato</hi> ſhews learnedly. And there is a difference between Chymiſtry and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſian Phyſick, for Chymiſtry was uſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of <hi>Paracelſus.</hi> And though he uſed it, yet it is not neceſſary that all Chymiſts ſhould be Paracelſians, and embrace his opinions. But let us examine whether thoſe arrogant Titles that he and his Diſciples attribute to themſelves, be due, or not.</p>
               <p>He brags that he was born of an ancient and Noble family in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Helvetia.</hi> But <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſaith that he heard that there were no ſuch there, that acknowledged themſelves of his kindred, not ſo much as an ignoble family; and that there was a ſtrange School-maſter that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there, who was born at a place called the <hi>High-neſt,</hi> and that he was called <hi>Paracelſus</hi> from thence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Operine</hi> a Citizen of credit in <hi>Baſil,</hi> followed him two years, of whom there are Writings by <hi>Jociſcus</hi> in his Life of <hi>Operine,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Paracelſus <hi>was drunk night and day, and could not be found one hour ſober, eſpecially after he left</hi> Baſil, <hi>and went to</hi> Alſatia, <hi>and was adored as</hi> Aeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culapius <hi>by the Nobles and Ruſticks. Operine</hi> adds further, <hi>That he never heard him pray, nor did he care for the Church, but ſlighted the Goſpel, which was then begun to be preached.</hi> Nor did <hi>Operine</hi> only write ſo, but told it to others, as Dr. <hi>Henry Bullinger</hi> that knew <hi>Paracelſus</hi> at <hi>Tigur,</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth whoſe Letters <hi>Eraſtus</hi> citeth. <hi>I could</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>find no Religion in his ſpeeches,

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:171520:14"/>Phyſitian, and loved the company of Carters, with whom he eat and carrouſed, ſo drunk ſomtimes, that he would ſleep upon any bench. For concluſion, he was a ſordid, naſty Fellow, ſeldom went to Church, and ſlighted Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eraſtus</hi> alſo ſaith that <hi>George Vetter</hi> a godly man learned,

               <p>He learned no Phyſick in the Schools, but had his knowledg from Chymical Books and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For about that time, and a little before, <hi>Iſaac Holland</hi> and <hi>Baſilius Valentine</hi> wrote, and practiſed Chymiſtry, and others; and it was wel known in <hi>Germany,</hi> as Books written before <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus,</hi> do declare. And he himſelf writes that he ſtudied Negromancy in the end of his Books of occult Philoſophy, where it is thus written. <hi>A Phyſitian cannot learn what he ought in the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſities, but muſt ſomtimes ask old Women, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers, and Negromancers, and old Mountebanks, and the like, and learn of them;</hi> and ſpeaking of Diſeaſes from Witchcraft,
<note place="margin">In praefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grani.</note> he ſaith, <hi>They have more knowledg of ſuch things, then all the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> And let any men judg if he wrote wiſely, when he ſaid that he had Letters ſent out of Hell from <hi>Galen,</hi> and diſputed with <hi>Avicen</hi> at Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates concerning his Potable Gold, the Tincture of Phyſick, Quinteſſences, and the Philoſophers Stone.</p>
               <p>If any obſerve his Travels, of which he writes

                  <hi>in his Praeface to his great Surgery,</hi> he may judge how ill they hang together, and how unlike to be true. Therefore it is more probable that he had no skill in Languages or Philoſophy, and therefore he travelled and conſulted with Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks and Negromancers.</p>

               <p>Let us ſee what he did in Chymiſtry and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring where his chief worth lay, which ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned him. As for the tranſmutation of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
<note place="margin">In Epiſt.

But how he did it, and whether he made the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine or had it from another it is not known. <hi>Evaldus Vagelius</hi> a Dutch-man in his Preface to his Book of the Philoſopher-ſtone writes thus of <hi>Paracelſus.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:171520:15"/>in that Art, and beſides certain reaſons, I was perſwaded to this belief by an Epiſtle from a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, whoſe Father knew <hi>Paracelſus</hi> very wel, for he had had the Philoſophers-ſtone, &amp; could make it when he pleaſed, he had not ſo railed at <hi>Philip</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Banden</hi> for ingratitude, in not paying his bargain.</p>
               <p>As for Chymical Medicines, he brought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to light, but not without envy, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated not faithful ſuch as he found out: for contemning all the ancient Chymiſts beſides himſelf, he is to be ſuſpected.

               </p>
               <p>His Epitaph ſhews what diſeaſes he cured, as the Leproſie, the Gout, and other incurable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies in the body by a wonderful art. And <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porine</hi> ſaith that he had an excellent activity and ſucceſs in compoſing of remedies againſt all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and that he wrought miracles in curing of all ſorts of deſparate ulcers, without any preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:171520:16"/>or obſerved courſe of diet, but he drank nights and daies with his patients, and cured them upon a full ſtomach and diet.</p>
               <p>He mentions the Medicines he uſed,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib. de tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. Philoſ. c.</hi> 2.</note> as the Philoſophical Tincture, for curing the French pox, Leproſie, Dropſie, Colick, Apoplexy, Eſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mene, Cancer, Fiſtulaes, and all inward Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but let them believe it that pleaſe. <hi>Oporine</hi> witneſſeth that he uſed Praecipitate, Treacle, or Mithridate, or juyce of Cherries in pills in all kind of diſeaſes for a purge. He often bragged he raiſed the dead to life by his Laudanum only. A certain learned Chymical Phyſitian, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the truth of this matter; and after he had read the Chyrurgery of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> he concluded that he cured all diſeaſes onely with Mercury, ſublimated and calcined, and give it divers names that it might not be diſcovered.</p>
               <p>Many conſeſs that he cured the moſt ſtubborn ulcers, but ſay that he did not perform what the Vulgar ſay he did in the cure of the Dropſie, Gout, Leproſie, Epilepſie, and the like, and prove by plain arguments, that he did not cure all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. And ſome doubt it, becauſe he uſed ſuch diverſity of remedies againſt the Epilepſie. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ſaith it is to be cured onely by black Hellebore, ſomtimes by Antimony, ſomtimes by the liquor of Gold, ſomtimes by the Tincture of Coral, ſomtimes by Vitriol, or by Mans blood prepared, or by Mans skull. And they think that he wrote down certain Medicines promiſcuoſly for his memory, that in time when occaſion was offered, he might make tryal of them all, and knew not which was beſt. And the diet of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> himſelf ſeems to confirm this, which was ſuch that he could not have ſuch knowledge in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:171520:16"/>the cure of ſo many deſparate diſeaſes. Nor could he cure himſelf, who was not only long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death in a convulſion, but lived not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 47. years when he had promiſed long life unto others: when the Univerſal medicine, if he had had it, would have preſerved, and freed him from all contagion.</p>
               <p>Hence any may judge that <hi>Paracelſus</hi> had a good wit, and if he had been endowed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly with the knowledg of Languages and ſolid Hippocratical and Galenical Philoſophy, and could have uſed it in Chymiſtry, he had advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Phyſick, and had been famous among Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians and Philoſophers For the want of which, he divulged ſo many abſurdities in Divinity, Philoſophy, and Phyſick without any reaſon, but ſate like a Dictator or Emperor in Learning, and wrote many things ſo ſooliſh and confuſed, that his Writings are not methodical, ſo that he is blind with the love of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> that ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of his mad Doctrine. His diſſolute life ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed that he was not a fit Reformer of Phyſick, much leſs a man abſolute in the knowledg of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane things.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT is proper to this Sect to deceive by Names and Titles, and to get the opinion of being wiſe thereby, witneſs the Titles of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his Books, as <hi>Paragranum, Paramirum:</hi> and theſe words, <hi>Ens, Pagoicum, Caſtagricum, Iliaſtrum, Achaeus, Relloleum, Cherionium, Ylech. Trara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:171520:17"/>Turban, Leffas,</hi> and ſix hundered other words never heard in any age: and none of the followers of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> hath ſhewed their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or to what language they belong, and when they uſe other, they give another ſenſe, and uſe parables.</p>
               <p>But the goodneſs of every thing conſiſts in that for whoſe cauſe it was made. Speech is a great gift of God given to men, that one might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their meaning to another, and that which doth not ſo, is not worthy the name of a ſpeech; for the knowledg of things follows the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of their Names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter Severinus</hi> is to be blamed for this, whom the Paracelſians follow at this day, as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> himſelf, he uſeth the word <hi>Anatomy</hi> often accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to nature and conſtitution of things; and ſomtimes he uſeth the ſame word for the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and diſſolving of things. Somtimes for the place, as when he ſaith, <hi>The ſeed is anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to the ſtones,</hi> that is flows to them. Alſo he uſeth the word <hi>Tincture,</hi> to ſignifie the propriety from whence the force of acting proceedeth, and repeats improperly almoſt in every leaf, <hi>the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Pleuriſie,</hi> meaning the cauſe of the plouriſie; and <hi>the invalid Tincture of diſeaſes,</hi> that is, the beginning of diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Paracelſus</hi> from whom <hi>Severinus</hi> had this trick, calls ancient things by new Names, but improperly. For the Hippocratical <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <hi>Cheirionia</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> are the ſame. <hi>(Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollaceum)</hi> is the ſame with that which is weak, and without power. <hi>Archaeus</hi> is the ſame with the natural ſpirit among Phyſitians and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, as if <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Severinus</hi> were ſuch, as they ought to leave the uſual words, and uſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:171520:17"/>new unheard of expreſſions. Nor is Chymiſtry a new thing, or firſt found out by <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> ſo that he was bound to give new names unto things when he might well have uſed the language and words of the old Chymiſts very properly. There is darkneſs ſufficient in Nature, ſo that he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to have increaſed it with monſtrous words. It may be they ſpake ſo that they might not be underſtood, and to get the Name of being wiſe among the ignorant, and that they might not eaſily be confuted by any.</p>
               <p>The concluſion is as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Speech is the Character of the mind, and a monſtrous ſpeech is the ſign of a monſtrous mind.</hi> And therefore it is intolerable to inſinuate words into an ancient Diſcipline, and to change the cuſtom of an art, and to deſire to bind up the art to ſuch terms: rather let the words be retained, which uſe hath approved, which is to judg of the force and form of ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>Let us come to the new way of teaching and knowing which they propound. Hitherto rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and experience were the original of all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and whatſoever agreed with them, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted true, and what differed from them, was rejected. And therefore the Works of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> are highly eſteemed. But <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and his followers, propound all their opinions without foundation, and begin a new way of knowing,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Praef. admonit. p.</hi> 3.</note> of which <hi>Crollius</hi> ſpeaks at large. <hi>A Phyſitian</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>muſt have the light of Nature and grace, from the internal and viſible Man, an internal Angel, and light of Nature</hi> And if you ask what this light of Nature is, he ſaith, <hi>It is the Firmament that gives man all things naturally.</hi> If it be asked again, Why they who
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:171520:18"/>teach in the Univerſities, have not the light of Nature alike? He anſwers nothing clearly, but flies to the light of grace, and ſpeaks of <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, That he was undoubtedly by the favour of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven made the Prince and Monarch of all Phyſick, but ſhews not how.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore falſe Chymiſtry hath its peculiar Religion, for becauſe they think they have refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or perfected all Philoſophy &amp; Phyſick, they ſtay not there, but proceed to Divinity, and mix prophane and holy things together: and ſo, they bring in any abſurdity, and diſpute wonderfully of the Kingdom of the Bleſſed, the Angels Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Faith, and the Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>But to come to our purpoſe, natural all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is ſo far true, as it agrees with things, for things meaſure our knowledg, but not on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, nor are things ſo, becauſe we think the ſo; but becauſe they are ſo, we think them to be ſo, when we know rightly: and this being not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in us, muſt come from without. Before the Fall, <hi>Adam</hi> had that knowledg, but none hath it ſince. Therefore whatſoever men know, is either immediately revealed from God by revelation, or learned another way. Since therfore the words of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> cannot challeng to themſelves a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar illumination, nor can we grant it; they muſt needs learn as other men did, and do, and learn knowledg from things.</p>
               <p>There is a twofold faculty of knowing in man, ſenſe and underſtanding. Things are preſented by the external ſenſes to the fancy, and by that to the underſtanding. And the ſoul while it is in the body, underſtands not without a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſm, and the beginning of knowledg is from the ſenſes; and we make principles from thoſe things
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:171520:18"/>that ſenſes have comprehended without error. From principles we go to things unknown, which may be concluded from them. This is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of knowing and learning, by which the unlearned learn from the wiſe, and are inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either by ſpeech or books. Thus were all the Paracelſians taught: for this cauſe <hi>Paracelſus</hi> took ſuch long journies. <hi>Crollius</hi> writes that he got his Chymiſtry by long travel, pains, and watchings, and obſervations. This may be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of others of that gang.</p>

               <p>THe whole Philoſophy of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> is built upon the Analogie of the great and little World which they extend largely. And they of <hi>Marpurg</hi> write the opinion of the Chymiſts thus. <hi>The Chymiſts call Man a little World,

Man carries all things about him, the whole Firmament, and all the Stars, and Planets. Man hath the parts of all the world, and there is nothing in it that is not really in him. He communicates with God in his mind, with Angels in his reaſonable ſoul, and his inviſible ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like body, and with the Stars with the ſame inviſible body, and with the Elements by his viſible earthly body.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:171520:19"/>
               <p>They ſay there are two bodies in every man, the one phyſical, elementary, viſible, and to be touched, made of earth, which the firſt man had from the earth. Another inviſible, inſenſible from the Stars. <hi>Crollius</hi> pag. 36. calls this <hi>the Genius, Houſhold God, ſhadow of Man, the little Man that the wiſe knew, Eveſter,</hi> and I know not what. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verinus</hi> ſpeaks warier of this, and diſſents not from it.</p>
               <p>On the contrary the Ariſtotelians and the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniſts uſe the ſame words with a divers mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                  </note> And though man be called often a <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſm,</hi> yet they render another reaſon, why he is ſo called, as ſaith <hi>Eraſtus.</hi> He hath a viſible E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary body, a Heavenly ſoul, that hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to grow and nouriſh as in Plants, ſenſible as in Brutes, and the mind is Angelical. Alſo he is like the World in the poſition of his members, and riſe of them. For there are three parts of the great World, <hi>The Elementary, Coeleſtial, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percaeleſtial</hi> To theſe three, man anſwers by the head, breaſt, and belly; the laſt, Religion an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the Elementary, in which there is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al generation and corruption. By the breaſt in which the fountain of vital heat, he anſwers to the Heavens, in which is the Sun, the original of heat to the world. In his head, where the mind abides, and from which all ſenſes come; he is not only like the Coeleſtial and Angelical world, but in that particular the image of God.</p>
               <p>Hence we may gather that the Analogie of the great and little World,
<note place="margin">In labyrin. med er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</note> is extended too large by the Chymiſts, becauſe they make not an Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, but an identity, or the ſame thing. For <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> requires in a true Phyſitian, that he ſay this is a Saphire in man, this is Quickſilver, this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:171520:19"/>Cypreſs, this a Walflower, but no Paracelſian ever ſhewed this.</p>
               <p>In this great world, not only are the Heavens and Elements, Metals and Minerals, but Plants and Beaſts. Therefore <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Severinus</hi> are out, ſaying, <hi>There is no flegm, choler, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy in the great World, therefore not in Man, for humors are found in Beaſts as in Men.</hi> Alſo I grant there are many hidden properties in man, that agree with many natural things, not only in general, but with their ſpecies or kinds, and alſo with their individuals, and diſſent alſo from them wonderfully. Hence comes the Sympathy and Antipathy of many things with mans body. The Aſtrologers affirm that peculiar Stars have agreement with the peculiar parts of our bodies. But the ſublunary things are better known, Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hung about the neck, cures the Epilepſie, Cantharides hurt the bladder, and no other part, the Saphire agrees with the heart, alſo Bezoar and Pearl, but the cauſes of this conſent and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and whence theſe hidden qualities ariſe, are hard to be found. And it is more hard to find out individuals in man, as Balm and Walflo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers. If <hi>Paracelſus</hi> could have done it, he had done well for profit; for as cold and heat, moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and drineſs are in man, becauſe the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in him: and as the vital heat in the heart like that in the Heavens, is ſent to the whole body; therefore becauſe they ſay the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Balm and other plants are in man, let them ſhew in what ſubject they are, and where they lie.</p>
               <p>They are alſo, becauſe the knowledg of man is only from outward things; for there is more in the ſpecies then in the genus, or general, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:171520:20"/>there is more in man who is the end of Natural things, then in other Naturals, and what man hath in him, he hath as a man.</p>
               <p>Therefore the ſoul that loves truth, is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with ſimilitudes onely, but deſires ſolid demonſtrations; and volves things from their own, not from the principles of another. And as they who think they have demonſtrative argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are often deceived, much more may they who uſe only compariſons. There is nothing ſo like, but in ſome part it is unlike. Moreover, the Chymiſts know not the great World all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, how then can they bring us to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the little World thereby? If they know it perfectly, let them examine themſelves, if they can arrogate that unto themſelves truly.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Paracelſus</hi> cals the firſt Matter of all things <hi>a great Myſtery,</hi> and ſaies thus of it. <hi>As a Child is born of its Mother,

               <p>That ſome Paracelſians are forgers, appears in that <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſpeaks otherwiſe of the firſt Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ter then his followers, and both without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Dornaeus</hi> ſay all creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things are from the firſt Matter and great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:171520:20"/>ſtery. But the late Chymiſts ſay the firſt Matter was put into rude maſs which was before it.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Myſtery, Paracelſus</hi> means nothing but the Matter which inviſibly contains ſomthing in it ſelf, or that out of which ſomthing comes that was not obſerved to be in it. <hi>So Dung is the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Beetles, Milk of Cheeſe, and Butter and Whey, Cheeſe of Worms or Mites.</hi> And to explain him. <hi>It is an Idea or Platonick Soul of the World, or the Chaos which many Philoſophers mentioned.</hi> For <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> his great Myſtery is like the Idea of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> for <hi>Plato</hi> writes thus. <hi>If this World be beautiful,
<note place="margin">In Timaeo.</note> and the Maker good, it is plain that it was made by an eternal and permanent Pattern.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. de ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma mundi.</note> And <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> calls this Idea, <hi>The great uncreated Myſtery,</hi> and ſaith all things came from it, and as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created, it agrees with <hi>Plato's</hi> Idea.
<note place="margin">Lib. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſo ad Athen.</note> In others it is the Chaos that ancient Philoſophers men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Therefore <hi>Paracelſus</hi> told us no news, but to make us think he did, he gives ſtrange names. And he is out, when he calls the great Myſtery uncreated; for it is againſt Scripture and reaſon, that any thing ſhould be uncreated beſides God.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Chymiſts ought not to inveigh againſt the firſt Matter of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſo much: let them take heed, leſt they ſpeak againſt the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all things, and diſpraiſe that which he ſaw to be good. For in regard there is a difference between the Matter and the form, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and corruption, and tranſmutation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things cannot be denied, we cannot deny the firſt Matter. The form only in the Elements is not the whole Eſſence; nor is it from the form that a thing is of ſuch a quantity: therefore there is ſomthing in material things, that with the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:171520:21"/>form makes up the whole, and ſuſtains the form, and in the Elements it is nothing but the firſt Matter. And becauſe all natural bodies are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, they muſt needs partake of the common matter. Let them that deny the firſt Matter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that it is one thing to be begotten, another to be created, another to be corrupted, another to be reduced to nothing. Thoſe are from ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſomthing; theſe from nothing to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And becauſe one thing is made of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the form is aboliſhed there muſt ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remain, that is the ſubject of the change. This <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> call the firſt Matter.</p>
               <p>And though its Eſſence diſtinct from its form, cannot be comprehended by ſenſe, but only by reaſon, yet it is not a being only of reaſon, or a meer figment, but a real being, and a ſubſtance or being diſtinct from an accident. But it hath of it ſelf properly no exiſtence, which is proper only to compound bodies. But it is wholly a power not as to its being, which it hath by its Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but as to its being thus or thus: nor was it created of God as a definite and diſtinct ſpecies of a natural thing, but it is rather created toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with natural things, and is as it were a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment and Principle: nor doth it remain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant any time without a form, but lies under it.</p>

               <p>Such is the confuſion of the Chymiſts in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the Elements, that we need an <hi>Oedipus</hi> to interpret. And which is worſt, they go contrary to the old Philoſophers, that is, from known things to unknown, by ſhewing of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.

                  <hi>Paracelſus</hi> denies not the Elements, nor his Diſciples, but they ſpeak of them otherwiſe then the old Philoſophers do. They ſay the Elements are viſible and inviſible. The viſible are the fire, air, water, and earth, which they ſcarce think worthy of the names of Elements, but call them <hi>dead bodies without ſecrets,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>But they ſay their Elements are inviſible, and they are the eſſence, life and act of all beings. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> calls them the <hi>Matrices</hi> that bear and nouriſh fruit. Nor, ſay they, can generations be made from theſe Elements, but there are ſeeds in them all, which at certain times do generate. So his Element is whatſoever produceth and nouriſheth fruit, or any created ſpecies. <hi>Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> divides the Elements into two Globes, to each he allows two Elements; to the upper, the Firmament, Heaven, Fire and Air: to the lower, the Earth, Water. And he ſaith each Element pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth its fruit. The fruits of the Firmament are Manna, and Dew-waters, Minerals, Metals, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and theſe Elements are not mixed.</p>
               <p>The modern Chymiſts follow <hi>Severinus,</hi> and <hi>Crollius</hi> ſaith they are lighter, but they are more dark. Thus he writes:
<note place="margin">In praefat. admonit.</note> 
                  <hi>Our viſible Elements are only the bodies and houſes of others and keep off their force. The Earth is twofold, the outward viſible, the inward inviſible. The outward is not an Element, but the body of the Element, and is Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury: but the Element of the Earth is Life and Spirit, in which the Stars of the Earth lie, which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:171520:22"/>by the body of the Earth produce all growing things:</hi> and ſo of the reſt. In which he follows the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> but differs from <hi>Severinus</hi> and other Chymiſts.</p>
               <p>But many things here cannot be proved. Firſt they abuſe the word <hi>Element</hi> contrary to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of all ages: for it properly ſignifies the leaſt part of that, from which the thing is made as from its matter. But their Elements are only places, matrices, receptacles. And the place differs much from the matter.</p>
               <p>The wiſer Chymiſts have three principles that come from the Elements, or are joyned in the compoſing of natural bodies. But <hi>Paracelſus</hi> puts his principles before the Elements, and from one mixture of <hi>Salt, Sulphur and Mercury,</hi> and makes <hi>Fire;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In labyr. med. err.</note> from another <hi>Air,</hi> another <hi>Water and Earth,</hi> which no Philoſophy can allow.</p>
               <p>Others make the Elements <hi>vile and ſervile Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> in diſgrace of God and Nature, who made all very good. They ſerve God and man, and all ſublunary creatures, and ſo are to be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nor are they by that of no value, or relol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as they ſay. For the Chymiſts know their actions, who can do nothing with heat and cold.</p>
               <p>They erre alſo in making the Elements <hi>groſs Bodies,</hi> though the Earth be. Alſo they erre in calling them <hi>viſible,</hi> they may ſee Earth and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but when they will ſee air or fire, I know not. They fooliſhly ſay they are dead, becauſe they never were alive. And it is worſe that they ſay, <hi>The Earth is curſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for their inviſible Elements,
<note place="margin">Inexam, philoſo.</note> we ſhal believe it when they prove any ſuch hidden under theſe: for their affirmations only cannot creat new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:171520:22"/>
                  <hi>Libavius</hi> writes well of <hi>Severinus: The good man ſaith he ſpeaks well, as if he came from the treaſure of Nature, and ſaw all open, but he proves nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Severinus</hi> his Eloments being without bodies and dimenſions, are not to be allowed; for all learned men ſay the principles of bodies are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal. He ſaies they are not infinite, therefore they have dimenſions and bounds. Nor doth it hang together, when he calls theſe incorporeal Elements, empty and void, and allows to them contrariety and reſiſtence, and explains their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Nature. It may be that <hi>Paracelſus</hi> put one Element within another, for the form and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of action, and original of all qualities: for when the external viſible Elements, which are inferior to their internal, have noble qualities, their Elements muſt have more noble qualities and actions; but they never ſhewed us any yet. They ſay in general, only that they are vital and ſtrong to nouriſh the ſeed of generation.</p>
               <p>Nor do they prove that ſeeds are without their ſpecies in the Elements as they ſay. Nor did God put ſeeds in the Elements in the Creation, but into the ſpecies of natural things in the Elements. Nor are ſeeds ſeen out of the individuals in the Elements, but only in the individuals of their ſpecies. Nor did God ſay in the Creation, <hi>Let the ſeeds of Plants be in the Elements,</hi> the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is in Animals. All things have their ſeed in themſelves, and multiply by force of the Divine Word, and ſo the ſpecies are preſerved.</p>
               <p>And to that they ſay from <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, We know they ſpake often from the opinion of the Vulgar and themſelves, and many things are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to</hi> Hippocrates <hi>which were not his.</hi> And
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:171520:23"/>many abſurdities are among the Ancients, moſt from ignorance of the Creation. <hi>Eraſtus</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines their Doctrine at large.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt qualities which they value not but call relolling and dead. It is fooliſh to fight againſt the experience of fenſe, by which it is plain, that the firſt qualities have great force for generation and corruption of natural things, and are as conſiderable as ſcent, ſavor and colour.</p>
               <p>While we deſend the Elements, we muſt not adhere to them alone, as ſome, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> knew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as in his Books of the Soul. And when he ſaith;
<note place="margin">2. <hi>de gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. anim. c.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>The vertue and power of every ſoul partakes of another body, which is more Divine then the Elements; and as the ſouls are more or leſs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo is the Nature of that body. For there is in all ſeeds which makes them fruitful, which is heat, not a fire, but a Spirit which is contained in the ſeed or froathy body. And the Nature in that Spirit is like the Element of the Stars, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander Aphrodiſaeus</hi> ſaith many things are in Nature that are known only by experience,

               <p>Alſo they knew the Sympathy and Antipathy of things, and we defend not them that know nothing but the firſt qualities. For alteration or

And to what they ſay, the ſtrange actions come from the form; though the qualities are the inſtruments of forms, and are directed by them, yet they never looſe their ſtrength or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but only exerciſe them. If any more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble action be done, it is from other faculties and qualities meeting. And while they are directed by their forms, they act not beyond the ſtrength of their ſpecies. As things differ in eſſence, ſo they differ in operations and inſtruments. For heat, the inſtrument of a vegetative ſoul,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>de gene. ann. c.</hi> 1.</note> only heats; but chyle is made in the ſtomach, not from heat, but the chyle-making faculty. So heat in the liver makes blood by ſanguification: but the ſoul never uſeth heat to cool, or moiſture to heat and dry, or any thing to act beyond its ſtrength. And the firſt qualities by what unſpeakable way ſoever mixed, are not poyſon in venemous beaſts, but the Nature of poyſon is from another princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:171520:24"/>And as divers actions are from divers forms, ſo Nature hath given divers inſtruments to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers forms, for divers actions. Therefore we muſt confeſs that the vertues in Natural things tranſcend the condition of the Elements, and are to be aſcribed, not to the Elements or matter of things, but to the forms and their qualities.</p>

               <p>And Stars, becauſe they keep the laws of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all natural actions. And Roots, becauſe in them all the fruitfulneſs of the Tree of the World is contained. And they ſay every Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath its ſeeds.</p>
               <p>And though the inſerior Elements have not ſuch perfect individuals, yet they have bodies to laſt for ever in their treaſury, by which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuity of the ſeeds and ſpecies, is kept from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>They ſay the <hi>Starrie Bodies</hi> of the lower Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are twofold; ſome are purer, like thoſe coeleſtial, and are not ſeen but by the induſtry of Artiſts: and as the ſeeds differ in their offices
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:171520:24"/>and proprieties, ſo do the bodies.</p>
               <p>All theſe are not new, but contain the vulgar Doctrine of forms, therefore they only put new names to things known.</p>
               <p>All famous Philoſophers thought that the ſorms of Natural things were a Divine and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable principle,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ideal Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſ. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.</note> and an inſtrument or hand of God the Creator. <hi>Galen</hi> calls the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works of generation, <hi>a great Art or Wiſdom,</hi> and the Chriſtian Philoſophers ſay they have not their power from themſelves, but their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor at firſt when he ſaid, <hi>Let Earth bring forth the herbs bearing ſeed, and the tree in its kind bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruit which hath its ſeed.</hi> The form or ſoul of things, Star or Root, is the act of a thing, and the cauſe why the matter is actually what it is, the perfection, quiddity, and the cauſe of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a body, and the image of a Divine eſſence. Therefore the modern Chymiſts call the Souls <hi>(Stars)</hi> for as <hi>Stars</hi> end their motions at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times, ſo do the ſouls obſerve laws of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Black Hellebore flouriſheth in Winter, the Daffodil in the beginning of the Spring, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets in <hi>March,</hi> Roſes in <hi>May,</hi> the Elder in <hi>June,</hi> the Vine and Hops in <hi>July,</hi> then they are ripe at a ſet time, and their motion ended, they reſt till the next year. And if we knew more of the Soul, we would declare it. Though <hi>Severinus</hi> braggs he knows more, ſaying; <hi>I have laid the Rudiments of this Nature, and it is not fit to deolare all.</hi> But he was ignorant without doubt, as all men are.</p>
               <p>Moreover <hi>Severinus</hi> ſaies that qualities, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, conformation, and other ſignatures come from theſe forms or ſeeds, and right, for while the inward form makes her body, ſhe makes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:171520:25"/>forms which <hi>Libavius</hi> needs not admire, for they do not by their own force, but as they are inſtruments in the hand of the Creator, who gives them this force, not immediately, but from his firſt bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Severinus</hi> was not the firſt that taught this, but <hi>Sealiger</hi> before him, ſaith, <hi>That qualities, quantities, number, and order, and ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are from the Soul, and ſhe made the body for her Temple.</hi> But for truth ſake, let us conſider this opinion farther, and ſpeak of the Original of Forms.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Of the Original of Forms.</head>
                  <p>THe Philoſopers did not only admire gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but labored to find out the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe, which made the matter ſo perfect, and and greatneſs, number, figure, and order, and other things in bodies that live.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. de form. foetus.</note> Some deſpaired, <hi>Galen asketh all the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that if they have found any truth, they ſhould communicate it, for nothing was yet known that could ſatisfie a learning Soul.</hi> The inquirers have divers opinions. For though neither the form, nor the matter is generated properly aſunder, but the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound; yet becauſe generation cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the form, it is demanded whence that is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fernel</hi> ſaith the form is ſent from without and ſhews that ſtrength is ſent to the ſeed with heat and ſpirit,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>de abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ter. cauſis.</hi>
                     </note> which by force of the womb, and a gentle heat, prepare the matter, that the form may be received; which done perfectly, the form comes from without by a natural mevitable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and from whence forms come: he ſaith, <hi>That Heaven brings forth many creatures and plants
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:171520:25"/>from no ſeed,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cap.</hi> 10.</note> and all the forms are contained in the form of Heaven in power, and Heaven being as it were great with child of many forms, begets al things.</hi> But he brings no probability to eſtabliſh this his opinion. The Heavens help the producing of things, and nouriſh them, as a remote cauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal: but give not the ſpecies to things, and if all forms ſhould flow from Heaven, there would be no univocal generation in inferior things, and the Trees and Beaſts were only the progeny of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a common opinion of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticks, that forms are raiſed from the power of the matter, but if the matter ſhould contain forms in it ſelf, and they came from it, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would be the moſt noble being, and a more noble principle then the form, and forms would be ſcarce worthy of the name of a principle.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay the matter doth not actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the form, but there is in it a diſpoſition to a form, which being compleated, then it is actual, what it was before in power. And the Nature of ſeed is, that when there is an adequate or fit ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe, it comes from power to be in act or form; and ſo this power is only a certain deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, that this, &amp; not that, ſhould be made of this matter. As for Example, a Chicken comes of an egg, not a Horſe. But whence is this act or form or ſubſtance? doth that power and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which is a quality, turn into a ſubſtance? or is the form made of nothing, ſo that the agent gives nothing of its eſſence unto it,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib. de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. ann. c.</hi> 11.</note> beſides acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? But both theſe are abſurd and contrary to truth; namely, either that the form is made of nothing or the act is produced from the matter, and the ſubſtance brought forth from an accident.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:171520:26"/>Therefore <hi>Zabarella</hi> writes better. ſaying, <hi>Thae when living Creatures beget their like, they commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate ſome of their own matter, and ſome of their own form; as they ſend forth animated ſeed, having the ſame vital faculty which is in the begetter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this opinion, it follows that a Living creature begets not its like, and forms do not multiply, which all the old Philophers affirm. For to a true generation and production of the like eſſence, a matter is not ſufficient with a propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to receive the form, for then the agent and the accident of heat would conferre more to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration then the begetter, becauſe it maketh the form be in act, which by the begetter was only in power. And ſo it is not explained, whence the ſubſtantial form of a thing, or the more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and chief part cometh.</p>
                  <p>And if we grant that every form wil multiply, we need not flie to the production of forms, from the power of the matter, for the ſpecies is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the multiplication.</p>
                  <p>So we muſt determine, that forms were made at the firſt Creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by a divine benediction, when God ſaid. <hi>Let the Earth bring forth fruit and herbs bearing ſeed, &amp;c.</hi> and increaſe and multiply by the begetter, by the help of the ſeed as one light is from another kindled, and manifeſts it ſelf, when it hath a fit matter and inſtruments fit for operations. But of this we have ſpoken at large in <hi>Hypomn.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>To return to our purpoſe. The modern Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts call that the <hi>Star, Seed,</hi> and <hi>Root of things,</hi> which the Philoſophers and Phyſitians cal forms and Souls; but let me tel them, they make things more dark then plain, and bring <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Seeds</hi> into Heaven without a cauſe. Yet they teach
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:171520:26"/>right, that theſe forms of themſelves are neither great, nor have diſtance of parts, nor bound to the dimenſions of the living creature, only they have quantity and dimenſions from the matter which they inform: as all turns of generation, and live it ſelf, force of action and power come from the forms.</p>
                  <p>Hence what they ſay of the progreſſion of ſeeds into a clean Scene, may be taken in a good ſenſe. For they ſay that every ſeed takes a body and fit qualities for its nature and uſe; as one to go u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a ſtage, takes a fit garment to act in: it is right, ſo that mean ſeeds coming from the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals of their ſpecies, not from Hell or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Elements, nor can any Peripatetick deny it, for a plant when it firſt groweth from the ſeed hath only two ſmal leaves, and not a perfect ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, but daily increaſeth to perfection, and ſo the ſoul of the plant makes it ſelf a body agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to its Nature.</p>
                  <p>Nor do we differ from them, when they ſay that hitherto many Philoſophers have aſcribed all actions almoſt to the firmament only, and the change in the Elements, is not from the ſtars born in them, but from the Stars in Heaven: and that ſeminal vertues and fruitfulneſs come from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Many Philoſophers have erred in this; firſt becauſe they ſaw inferior things to be cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the benigne heat of Heaven, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up, therefore they thought to bring the forms of things from Heaven, when indeed every thing hath its form in it ſelf that can be multiplied. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe they obſerved the motions of the Heavens to be moſt orderly; when they ſaw any thing orderly, and to return, and certain periods beneath, they ſaid the cauſe of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:171520:27"/>motion was from Heaven, when indeed that conſtancy and orderly change comes from the force of things within.</p>
                  <p>But we differ from the Chymiſts in this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſay that the <hi>Seeds</hi> &amp; <hi>Stars</hi> are in their inviſible Elements, and dwell there as in a pure Countrey, and reſt bleſſedly, and then are ſent into bodies. For the forms of Natural things are no where, but in the individuals of their ſpecies, by which alone they are preſerved and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Nor doth <hi>Severinus</hi> ſpeak right of this, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That the Seeds in the Celeſtial Element produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Individuals, that were to endure for an age, as the Sun, Moon and Stars, for the moſt perfect bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies have their Seeds.</hi> For we know from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that God created the Lights and the Stars, as &amp; placed them in Heaven, which cannot grow Plants do out of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>And obſerve the modern Chymiſts abuſe the Name of life, and extend it too large, when they give life to the ſtars, and ſay they have vital ſeed, when indeed nothing can truly be ſaid to live, in which there appears no operation of any ſoul, at leſt of a vegetative or growing ſoul. They ſay, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, Minerals, Gemms</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> do live, but life in them is nothing but an Energy or operation, which is in all things, <hi>Salt, Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Vitriol, Arſenick, Metals, Gemms</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> do live, becauſe they have a ſcent, are to be taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and have other powers. For they ſay, that which hath no force or efficacy is dead: but they are out, for to act, is more general then to live, and none wil ſay that a withered dead plant is alive, but that which hath power to act; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the opinion of Paracelſians, dead plants might be ſaid to be alive, and the ſame thing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:171520:27"/>might be at the ſame time dead and alive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his Followers are more ſound, who ſay that Natural things are either animated or vital, and not vital, and the principle of life is only the ſoul, and where there is no ſoul, there is no life, and therefore the parts of Plants and Animals being dead, though they have ſome force to act, yet can live longer.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the life of <hi>Metals, Gemms,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>In lib. de ſubtilit. &amp; apud Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig. exercit.</hi> 102.</note> and <hi>Stones,</hi> not only Chymiſts, but <hi>Cardan</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers attribute life to Metals. I ſay that they erre commonly in that they take <hi>Metals, Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> and <hi>Gemms,</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> for mixed bodies, only and ſimply, and teach that they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them beſides the Elements mixed, and the form by which one Metal differs from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is only the form of mixture. For the effects of Minerals and Metals ſhew otherwiſe, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the more noble, that they cannot be aſcribed only to the Elements. Moreover their peculiar colours, properties and ſhapes ſhew the ſame, for Cryſtal is of one figure, the Diamond of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; ſome Jewels grow, and are congealed, which cannot be from only heat or cold, but from an internal form, which makes its habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as in Plants and Animals.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I ſhall not ſay that <hi>Metal, Gemms,</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> live and are nouriſhed, for in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, parts only grow to parts, but they increaſe not in all dimenſions, yet every one hath its ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick form, beſides the form of mixture, out of which as in Vegetables and Animals the figure &amp; qualities ariſe. And I think it not abſurd, to ſay that every form hath its force to multiply it ſelf. For it is moſt certain, that the Veins of Allum, Vitriol and Metals, being exhauſted, after ſome
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:171520:28"/>time have been filled again;

                  <p>Nor is it abſurd in Minerals, to ſay that the Spirit that makes gold or ſilver, wil grow with a ſit matter, and being gold or ſilver, and this gold and ſilver before it grow ſolid, and be boyled out can ſend from it ſelf gold and ſilver-making ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which may turn a fit matter into gold or ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſo the Mines are kept ſtill full.</p>

<note place="margin">3. <hi>de ſympt. med. fac. c.</hi> 9.</note> and it is better with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to call this ſubſtance a Spirit, then with the Phyſitians <hi>(a Natural Heat)</hi> although it ſignifies not only a naked quality, but a ſubſtance. Yet this appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:171520:28"/>came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the perfecteſt animals, which are hot when touched, and act by a heat that may be felt: for in plants there is the ſame ſpirit, but it is not to be felt, though it is in the coldeſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in them.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Spirit</hi> is uſed diverſly, but here for a ſubſtance thin and ſubtile that belongs to the conſtitution of animals, vegetables, and other things, which the form or ſoul uſeth as a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple inſtrument to act by.</p>
               <p>But whether is this Spirit of <hi>Ariſtoles</hi> of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary Nature? We deny not that it is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with elementary heat, ſo that it can ſcarce be found without it, as the animal faculty is not found without the natural. But if you ask if that Spirit have nothing in it but what is elementary, we anſwer with <hi>Fernel, Variola, Schenkius,</hi> and others, that there is ſomthing ſpiritual in natural things beſides the Elements.</p>
               <p>To prove this, take <hi>Scaligers</hi> arguments,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exercit.</hi> 307.</note> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Every form of a perfect mixture, though it be not a ſoul as in a Diamond, hath a fifth Nature di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct far from the four Elements.</hi> From whence there is a ſtrong argument againſt <hi>Alexander</hi> that made the ſoul to be compoſed of the four Elements. There is in the powers of the ſoul which never was in the powers of any Elements. But there is nothing contained in any thing that was not actual in its principles: for the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are the acts of thoſe things of which they are principles. But in the ſoul there is faculty to move forward, backward, to the right or left, which is not in any Element; alſo there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny powers in the ſoul which are not in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>This ſtrong argument we apply thus to our
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:171520:29"/>purpoſe: <hi>There is that in the powers of this Spirit or heat, which never was in the powers of any Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the powers are more excellent. Therefore this Spirit is not only from the Elements.</hi> Another is from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> though he only applies it to Seeds.
<note place="margin">2. <hi>De gen. ani. c.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>That which partakes of a Spirit, in which there is a Nature that anſwers in a certain proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the heavenly heat, hath a body better then the Elements.</hi> But every ſoul hath ſuch a Spirit, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it partakes of a body better then the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For certainly there is a more divine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue then the Elements, in a body that is better then the Elements. For the vertue and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject muſt anſwer each other; hence it is that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the noblenſs and ignobleneſs of the ſoul, the begetter of thoſe vertues, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject body, are different. And becauſe this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit makes fruitful ſeeds, like the coeleſtial heat in proportion, I thus argue. <hi>A heat like the caele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial, is more divine then an elementary heat, but the heat of the ſeed is ſuch, therefore it is more divine.</hi> I prove the major from the efficacy of both heats: That heat is more like coeleſtial heat, whoſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration comes nearer to the efficacy of a coeleitial heat: but the heat of the ſeed comes nearer the acting to the coeleſtial heat then the heat of the Elements; and therefore is more like the coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial heat:

Therefore <hi>Libavius</hi> writes that neither the common Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor the vertue of them all, nor any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of them, can effect that Rhubarb ſhould purge, or that a flie ſhould not be bred. The heat of Animals is from the Elements, as it is heat, but as it is fruitful, it is from a nobler cauſe. As for examples the hammer makes a pot, not as it is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:171520:29"/>iron, but as it hath a power from the Artificer.</p>
               <p>If they ſay this heat is elementary, but it acts more powerfully in a mixt body then when it is ſimple, we ſay that it cannot act beyond its ſtrength in a mixt body, and nothing can do what is not in its own nor in the Elements pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with which it is mixed. And if theſe noble actions may be from the mixture of Elements &amp; temper of the firſt qualities, why may not life, voluntary motion ſight, and all animal actions, and the Soul it ſelf as <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaith be fetcht from the ſame mixture?</p>
               <p>We grant that heat doth much as it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the Soul, which alone it cannot do, as it hath divers effects, as to make chyle in the Stomach, blood in the Liver, but theſe actions are not to be attributed to heat alone, but to the Soul that uſeth the heat. Yet it followeth not hence that all actions which are nobler then thoſe of the Elements come from the Soul, for the dead parts of beaſts have ſome operations and force which cannot be reduced to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Why then may there not be actions in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures and accidents which come not from the Soul? what is common to the Soul with Scents, Savors, Colours? Therefore do they that deny this heat to be like that of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement of the Stars, in vain flie to the Soul: For the divers diſtinct qualities, affections and actions in natural things are to be refer'd to the diſtinct principles from whence they flow, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſpecies hath its proper qualities and powers as reaſon is in a man, heat, cold, moiſture, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, come from the Elements, and divers tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments that ariſe from them, alſo lightneſs and heavineſs, and what cannot be referr'd to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:171520:30"/>theſe, comes from another principle.</p>
               <p>To this belong the intentional qualities, as the viſible ſpecies known to all, and others like: hence are many hidden conſents and diſſents of things which have their ſubjects, in which they are and from whence they come, as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, many cannot abide the preſence of a Cat though ſhe be in a Cupboard, and they neither ſee nor hear her. So there are many hidden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of heavenly bodies, which affect a man, and yet they are not perceived either by ſight, hearing or ſcent, or any other ſenſe, but only by the affect: we confeſs that ſomthing doth flie out of the Load-ſtone to the Iron by which it comes to it, but ſenſe cannot comprehend it.</p>
               <p>And this is the chief foundation of natural magick (if there be any) ſome ſay it is the perfection of Natural Philoſophy which doth wonders by the fit application of Agents and Patients, others deny it. Firſt, becauſe Phyſick is a Science, but this Magick is an operation, therefore it cannot be the end and perfection of Natural Philoſophy. Secondly, what is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Baptiſta Porta</hi> concerning Natural Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick are not above and beſides the condition of Nature.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prius Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. de rer. praeuol. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> They think beſt of this, that ſay ſome Magick is from the Devil by an open and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs league; another which is honoured of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as being Natural, which comes from a ſilent bargain with the Devil, and to this belongs that which <hi>Plato</hi> writes of in his <hi>Alcibiades:</hi> thus the Magick of <hi>Zoraſter</hi> is in the worſhip of Gods which were Devils. It was famous among the Aegyptians and Chaldaeans, and the Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians at this day commend it highly. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not that Magick Natural, which goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:171520:30"/>the bounds of Nature, and which conſiſts in a Sympathy of Natural things.</p>
               <p>But to the buſineſs. The conditions of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat are different from thoſe of the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary: for in cold Animals and Plants cold in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their elementary temper, the inbred Heat is the cauſe of all attraction, excretion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, generation and life, this is not in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, and the heat there is not contrary to the cold, for Plants and their ſeeds and roots in winter and froſt keep their ſtrength, and often they grow under the Snow, and if that heat were Elementary, it would be eaſily overcome of the cold.</p>
               <p>Moreover, that Spirit and body like the Air is ſwifter and lighter then any Element, and hath fit heat to perform all actions agreable to its kind, from whence it hath its denomination in Animals:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>de mundo.</hi>
                  </note> Alſo this body hath great piercing force, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls it a Spirit.</p>
               <p>Nor is it abſurd for Spirits to pierce each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the Animal, Vital, and Natural paſs through each other without confuſion; as may be obſerved in the Eye, which lives, feels and fees, which actions are performed by divers mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>It is not hard to anſwer <hi>Zabarells</hi> argument concerning the heat like the Airy Element. He thinks there are not two heats in a living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, one Elementary the other Vital, becauſe two accidents cannot be in one ſubject, of the ſame ſpecies diſtinct in number. Firſt I deny that they are of the ſame ſpecies. Secondly, that they are in the ſame ſubject, the Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heat hath fire for its ſubject, the vital or coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial hath the ſpirit or body like the Element of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:171520:31"/>Stars. and if the ſubjects be mixed, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders that theſe two heats ſhould be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited.</p>

               </p>
               <p>They call theſe Vital Principles, becauſe they give ſtrength, faculty and power to things, and are the cauſes of actions. They call them alſo formal Principles, becauſe they give power of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to things, and open the hidden waies of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſupply the explication of occult qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
               <p>Now are there ſuch principles; How, and of what things are they principles?
<note place="margin">In labyrin. med. errant.</note> I reject their opinion, becauſe they ſay they were before the Elements and Heaven is made of them. For they have not proved them to be the principles of things ſubject to generation and reſolution.</p>
               <p>The Learned modern Chymiſts dare not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend this, but ſay the Elements were before theſe principles in order of natural bodies. Therefore let us ſee whether there are other principles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Elements, of natural ſublunary bodies,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:171520:32"/>Metals, Minerals, Gemms, Stones, Flants, and Animals? I ſay Chymical principles were not before the Elements as ſimple bodies, but either mixed or peculiar natures made at the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with other kinds of natural things, as the principles of their kind, which among themſelves and mixed with the Elements, give convenient matter to other natural things ſubject to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and corruption, as Metals, Minerals, Gems, Stones, Plants and Animals.</p>
               <p>When I ſay they were mixed, I deny not the concurrence of other Elements to their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as reſolving of them doth prove to the Chymiſts. Moreover, I ſuppoſe that they have their peculiar forms from God in the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as was given to other kinds of natural things as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exercit.</hi> 138. <hi>ſ.</hi> 20.</note> 
                  <hi>The form of every perfectly mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed body, though it be not a Soul, as in a Diamond, is of a fifth Nature, and far differing from the four E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements.</hi> And I ſuppoſe that from theſe diverſly mixed, by concurrence of the Elements, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers bodies of natural things are made, and that the divers qualities and accidents come imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the ſame, as from their firſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubjects, which others in vain bring from the Elements only: for there is no force in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to produce ſcents, ſavors and colours. And if there be any, it is that Spirit which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith is like the Element of the Stars.</p>
               <p>And let none think that there is a matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for mixture from the regions of the four Elements: for when God created the Elements, he mixed them by his Word, and gave them their peculiar forms, and ſeminal, and eſſential rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, like thoſe of Heaven, and ſo he keeps on ſtill the courſe of Nature by propagation of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:171520:32"/>ſpecies in the Individuals. And now ſince the Creation thoſe principles are to be ſeen in the Water and the Earth from divers corruptions.</p>
               <p>For as the order in Nature is that inferior things ſhould ſerve the ſuperior, ſo it is in bodies the Elements are firſt: thence Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, or the firſt mixture by what Name ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever termed; which though made of Elements, yet have they forms by which they differ, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe not from the forms of the Elements mixed together, but from the firſt Creation. Then from theſe being diverſly mixed, by concurrence of the Elements, Minerals, Metals, Stones, and Gemms, Plants, and Animals receive their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and bodies; in which by the form of every ſpecies, they are diverſly bounded: as we ſee Salt drawn from the Earth, may be taken out of the Plants that drew it, and Creatures feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon plants, are changed, but never plainly change their Nature.</p>
               <p>And this is not againſt the Ancients, though theſe names are not mentioned, it is ſufficient that the thing is ſtil extant, and we may put new names to things newly known, becauſe words are at mens diſpoſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Lib. de nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huma.</note> 
                  <hi>That Plants drew not only heat and cold, moiſture and drineſs, or that which was mixed of them, but whatſoever was in the Earth agreeable to their Nature, whether four or bitter, ſweet or ſalt.</hi> And man is nouriſhed of them, and every living creature alſo, and therefore they are in man and them, and natural bodies are made of them being mixed; and when they are well tempered together, they cannot be ſeen, nor be troubleſom to man. But when they are not well tempered, they offend: he writes thus. <hi>Heat
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:171520:33"/>alone is not the cauſe of a diſeaſe,
<note place="margin">Hippocr. lib de ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceri medici.</note> but heat and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or heat and ſharpneſs, or heat and ſaltneſs, and many more are the cauſes of diſeaſes.</hi> Hence the cure of peſtilent, malignant and venemous diſeaſes is divers, and hence are the divers Symptomes in malignant and peſtilent Feavers and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which cannot be from only putrefaction or diſtemper.</p>
               <p>And though <hi>Hippocrates</hi> names not plainly Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, yet the Chymiſts cal them four, bitter and ſalt.</p>
               <p>But by what arguments we may prove there are ſuch Principles? Firſt, whereſoever the ſame affects and qualities are in many, they muſt be in them by ſome common principle, as all things are heavy by reaſon of the earth, and hot by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the fire: but colours, ſcents ſavors and the like, are in Minerals, Metals Stones, Jewels and Plants Therefore they are in them by ſome common principle and ſubject but the Elements are not ſuch a principle becauſe they have no power to produce ſuch qualities. Therefore we muſt ſearch for ſome other principles. And they are deceived who think to prove colours, ſcents and ſavors to come from the Elements.</p>
               <p>The next is the argument of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ariſt.</hi> 3. <hi>de coel. c.</hi> 3. <hi>Gal. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de ele. c</hi> 3.</note> Natural bodies are made of ſuch things as they are reſolved into, but they are reſolved into thoſe three principles, therefore they are made of them. It is evident that Salt is in all things, and may be drawn from them, as from Plants and Animals. And though Chymiſts ſay that Metals are made only of Sulphur and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, yet they ſpeak of the next principles, as Phyſitians when they ſay that ſeed and blood are the principles of mans body, deny not the four
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:171520:33"/>Elements. And he that knows Metals right, and can make Cryſtals of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may eaſily find Salt in them. And though all mixed bodies taſt not Salt, yet it doth not thence follow that there is no ſalt in them: nor can we deny fire to be in all mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though all things are not felt to be hot: nor is this Salt to be accounted earth, becauſe Salt is hot and dry and clenſing, but earth is cold and dry.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid of Salt, may be ſaid of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, it is plain to be found not only in Plants,
<note place="margin">In praeſat. in Georg. Agricolam</note> but Metals and Minerals, and as <hi>Cornelius Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> writes, Sulphur is in all Metals except gold, I mean combuſtible Sulphur that will flame and ſmell as the ordinary Brimſtone. Nor are they bound to ſhew the pure principles, it is enough to ſhew the bodies in which they excel.</p>
               <p>The forms of Chymical Elements or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples do not their duty then,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zabarel. de generat. &amp; interm. c.</hi> 2.</note> but ſince forms are made for a more active compoſition, the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors are made ſubject, and are inſtead of matter, and are called hot or dry, as they are mixed by the predominate Element. So from theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are four, ſalt, combuſtible and ſcented things, and when a mixed body is corrupted, ſome parts turn to fire, earth and air, others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salt, others into Sulphur, and to be plain and ſhort, the Chymical principles are in other mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the Elements are in them, and are ſo brought forth: now in the next Chapter we ſhal ſhew how Elements are in mixed bodies: but for the matter in hand, I am of their ſide that hold the Elements are whole in mixed bodies according to their forms; and when a mixed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is reſolved again into the Elements, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments return not again in ſpecie or kind, but in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:171520:34"/>number, I ſhal ſtand to this, till I am convinced by ſolid reaſon.</p>
               <p>Nor is the ſame quantity of Salt or Sulphur drawn by the ſame fire out of any body, for much Salt is drawn from Wormwood, Fennel, Vine-branches, but very little from the Gourd or Cowcumber.</p>
               <p>But they object that the reſolution is artificial not natural, and the axiome that all things are made of ſuch things as they are reſolved into, is ment of natural, not artificial reſolution. But we deny that Chymical reſolutions are not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, if we conſider the immediate agent though the Artificer be joyned, for they are from heat and fire, which are natural cauſes; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: When a plant is burnt to make Salt, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is plainly natural, not in reſpect of the plant which is deſtroyed, but in reſpect of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. When the ſpirit of Wine is raiſed by heat, the action is as natural as when the ſame ſpirit is ſent to the brain by the heat of the ſtomach and liver, or when a thing is evaporated by the heat of the Sun. Therefore we ſay, the thing made by the Chymiſts is natural in its being, the action of heat by which it is made is natural, and the motion of the thing is natural. But it is artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial in reſpect of the Chymiſts putting it into a veſſel, and applying fire to it: nor is it any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe artificial then health, which is recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the help of a Phyſitian.</p>
               <p>The uſe of Chymical principles is, that the proprieties which are in mixed bodies, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be immediately ſhewed from the Elements, may be ſhewed from them, as the next and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per principles; as it is plain in the ſearching out of the faculties of Medicines. For though <hi>Eraſtus</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:171520:34"/>thinks that all theſe may be fetcht from the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he proves it not; let them tell me why, when Opiats are diſtilled, the vapors cauſe ſleep, ſo that the ſervants are many times ſound aſleep, other vapors do not the ſame? Why doth the fume of Lead and Quickſilver corrode gold, not the fume of Vitriol and other things? Why doth only a flegm diſtil from ſpirit of Vitriol and ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Earth? Theſe queſtions cannot be anſwered without the Principles of the Chymiſts, onely from the Doctrine of the Elements and Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.</p>
               <p>Nor do I think all the proprieties of bodies are to be reduced to the Chymical principles, for ſome come from nobler forms, as I ſhewed. Nor am I of opinion in all things, and I diſpute not here whether the force of purging be from Salt; only in general I ſay ſome properties are from Salt, others from Sulphur, and in what mixture ſoever ſuch a property is found, there you muſt ſeek for the principle, hence ariſe the profitable ſeparations of Chymiſts.</p>
               <p>But note, theſe common Principles as ſuch, are not proper and next principles of particular affects; nor is force of purging from Salt, nor is a narcotick force from Sulphur as Sulphur, for then all Salts would purge, and all Sulphur would be narcotick. But theſe principles as they are common, are only the principles of common affects, but the ſpecial affects come from deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate principles.</p>
               <p>So we have ſhewed in general, that beſides the Elements, there are other principles of mixed things, nor is the generation made immediately from the Elements, but there are other bodies which as the firſt ſubjects, ſome qualities do
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:171520:35"/>flow, which cannot come from the Elements, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> acknowledged, and the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts have given them names: and I care not what the names are, ſo the thing be true.</p>
               <p>But as for the ſpecies, number and nature of particulars, it is not clear, I will pin my ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no mans ſleeve, but give my judgment, not to diſſent, but conſent with the Ariſtotelians and Galeniſts, if it may be.</p>
               <p>The three Principles are, <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> I'le give my judgment of every one. Firſt for Salt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 31. <hi>hiſt. nat. c.</hi> 7.</note> it is ſo plainly in every natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, Salt is a neceſſary Element, only conſider the growth of Plants, what makes them fruitful and flouriſh: the chief cauſe is piſs which hath much Salt, and conſider that there is no art uſed.</p>
               <p>As for the properties of Salt. It is firſt a thing to be taſted, and all things to be taſted are ſo from Salt; nor is Kitchin-ſalt the only Salt, but that in Muſtard, Rhadiſh, Garlick, Vinegar, Choler, Allum, Vitriol, and the like. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe taſt and feeling are ſenſes united, and have objects alike, acrimony is aſcribed alſo to Salt, and that which twitcheth the feeling is Salt. Hence there is in ſmoak, Radiſhes, Watercreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Onions, and the like force to twitch the eyes from the volatile Salt in them, Secondly, Salt will melt in moiſture, and be hard in a dry place which earth will not, and though earth diſſolve in water, yet it melts not in it as Salt, much leſs will earth melt in a moiſt air as Salt wil. Thirdly, from Salt is the coagulation of all things, the Cryſtal and Diamond are hard from Salt, the Metals are ſtrong, alſo Bones, Herbs, and Trees conſiſt by it.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:171520:35"/>
               <p>Alſo the ſtone in the bladder and kidnies grow together from Salt. The Chymiſts prove this by many things in the Sea that grow, as Coral and Waters that make ſtones, the growing of Vitriol and Allum, and other Salts in the water. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they who have the ſtone, piſs like ſnot or the white of an egg, which taken into a clout, turns to a ſtone, and it hath much Salt, becauſe it is ſharp and corroding, and cauſeth pain in piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the cauſe of theſe cannot be heat, cold, or drineſs. For ſtones bred in the bladder in cold and membranous parts, and in infants in whom there is no exceſs of heat, but manifeſt ſigns of crudity. And how can a ſtone-making juyce be cauſed of heat in a cold Well that turns, ſticks into ſtones? Nor can cold be the cauſe, becauſe ſtones are found in the arteries of the heart, and in the heart and lungs. Nor are theſe cauſes by accident, or by drying up the moiſture; for in ſome waters things turn to ſtone, of which <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhelme Boetius</hi> ſpeaks. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de gemmis c.</hi> 300.</note> Alſo ſtones breed in the kidnies and bladder, where moiſture is never wanting, and there can be no ſuch drying.</p>
               <p>Hence they think it in vain to ſeek for the cauſe of concretion in external cauſes, but to conſider the internal matter and diſpoſition, by which ſtones are made hard: nor are they againſt Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>I ſhall deliver my opinion in ſhort. Firſt there are many equivocations by which they are bafled in the cauſes of coagulation and concretion, for concretion and coagulation are not the ſame, for juyces and gums, and water, and many other things may be concreted, as ice by cold, and clay by the Sun. There is Cryſtal and glaſs, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Metal, but they are not concreted from the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:171520:36"/>ſame cauſe; nor is water or Cryſtal hard or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted from the ſame cauſe. To ſpeak diſtinctly, the queſtion is not here of things which are coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, and made hard only by drineſs, after the moiſture is conſumed, by which they were ſoft before, or by nature were concreted, and made fluid by heat, and then concreted again by cold. But in regard many things congeal in moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and grow together hard, whoſe cauſe is neither heat nor cold nor drineſs, we muſt think of another internal cauſe.</p>
               <p>Two kinds of concretion are to be here conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, which are when no part of the matter is taken away, or any other added, but the whole taking its conſiſtence and concreſcence from moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, which we want fit words to diſtinguiſh. The Chymiſts call one of theſe by the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutch word <hi>Schieſſen:</hi> this coagulation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of Salts, as Vitriol, Allum, Niter; Salts of Herbs, come from a moiſture to a conſiſtence. This is of Salt properly, and they by nature tend to this by their form. But being there is one form by nature of Niter, another of Vitriol, another of Allum, another of common Salt. Every Salt according to its form and proper ſpirit, coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and grows together in this or that figure, ſo do Gemms concrete in certain figures,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſc. pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. v.</hi> 9.</note> for every form makes bounds to the bigneſs and quantity and ſigure, as <hi>Zabarel</hi> ſhews.</p>
               <p>Another ſort of concretion is called <hi>Lapideſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia</hi> or turning to ſtone, the next and adequate cauſe of this, is not the Elements, nor the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chymiſtry only, but a ſtone making juyce or ſpirit, which is not without Salt, and contains more then Salt, as the order of nature is, to go from ſimples to things more compound. This
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:171520:36"/>is in all Jewels and Stones, but according to their ſpecial forms. We ſaid it was a ſpirit and a juyce, but the chief force is in the ſpirit, and the juyce hath it from the ſpirit, becauſe that ſtone-make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force is found in the ſpirit without the juice.</p>
               <p>As for the differences of Salts, they are alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in divers Plants and Animals, as in corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humors there are divers differences. There is Salt in Vitriol, Allum, Sal Armoniack, Iron. There is a volatile Salt in a Nettle, Arſmart, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kow-pints, ſmal Celandine, Muſtard. There is a ſalt in humors that cauſeth the Itch, Scab, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and other corroding Ulcers. There are made Salts, as Borax, Sal Armoniack, and the like.</p>
               <p>Sulphur is another Principle of the Chymiſts, which is properly to burn, and nothing burns without it. The Elements of themſelves are not inflamed, and if they ſeem to burn, it is from the ſulphurous vapors in them. Therefore Sulphur is the firſt ſcented thing, and other things are ſmelt by their Sulphur, many things that are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſweet, being whole, ſcent not, but when they are burnt or bruiſed. Hence it is that Sulphur and Fats ſcent not much but when they are burnt or ſmoak.</p>
               <p>Some joyn ſcents and ſavors in a ſubject, and ſay the ſcent is of the ſavory part, but experience ſhews otherwiſe; for there are many moſt ſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſharp things which have little or no ſcent as Arſenick, Sublimate, Mercury, and other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding Minerals that have little or no ſcent.</p>
               <p>Some impute colours to Sulphur, and more probably then to Salt, but in colours the matter is more difficult. <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Interpreters that bring colours from the mixture of the Elements, proye nothing. Therefore let the principle of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:171520:37"/>colours be Sulphur, or as <hi>Anſhelme Boetius</hi> ſaith, God himſelf who gives colours as well as ſhape to Jewels, and the like, for they come from the proper ſeminary of every thing.</p>
               <p>Common Sulphur, Petroleum or Naphtha, Amber and Sea-coal have much Sulphur. Gums and Roſins of fat Trees, as Pine, Fir tree, Pitch, Oyl, and the like. Fats of Beaſts, of which ſee <hi>Libavius.</hi>

<note place="margin">In exami. Philoſo. vit.</note> and Sulphur and Mercury in Salt, and Mercury and Salt in Sulphur, and then he gives this definition. <hi>Mercury is an eſſential Liquor drawn by the Chymiſts from a mixed body af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the elementary impurities are ſeparated, oppoſite to the Sulphur and Salt of the ſame mixed body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſpeak my mind, if there be any ſuch Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, it is a ſpiriful Liquor or Spirit, which can ſcarce be ſeparated from ſubtile Sulphur and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt to be ſeen by it ſelf: and though it be not ſeen, it is no matter, for pure fire is not ſeen, nor air, nor the ſpirit in Animals, which are true parts of the Nature of things, and the beſt. <hi>Such things</hi> (ſaith Scaliger) <hi>deceive the vulgar eyes, but wiſe men ſee them.</hi> But I appeal to the Learned,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:171520:37"/>whether I be abſurd in making theſe principles mixed with the Elements, the common matter for the habitation of forms of the Natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>To conclude Metals, Minerals, Stones, and Gemms, and Plants are not ſimply mixed, and have not only their forms from the forms of the Elements, much leſs from a double exhalation which maketh the next matter of Meteors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have better actions, then are from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary qualities and a double exhalation. But the Elements give them matter with the chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical. Principles, and may hence be better by the cauſes of many things, then from the doctrine of Meteors. We can clearly ſhew Salt and Sulphur from a Chymical ſeparation, though they are not manifeſt before.</p>
               <p>We deſire to know more of Mercury, not of the Metal, but of the Principle. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes all to a Spirit, which the Chymiſts do to Mercury, for <hi>Quercetan</hi> and <hi>Beguin</hi> call it a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or body to be paſſed through penetrated, aethereal, pure, ſubtile, quickning, and the next inſtrument of the form, and call it the Spirit of ancient <hi>Hermes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Chymiſts call that <hi>vital Sulphur,</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls the <hi>Natural heat,</hi> and deſcribe their Mercury as that it is in the Natural heat. And this Sulphur and Mercury are ſo united in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they cannot wel be ſeparated, but when the Sulphur is on fire, Mercury flies away. Alſo the actions from the whole ſubſtance, and the hidden qualities are attributed to this Spirit, as to the proper ſubject; this in poyſons is a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſpirit, in purges a purging ſpirit.</p>
               <p>As for the original of theſe Principles, ſome
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:171520:38"/>think them to be the firſt mixtures: others to be peculiar natures in the firſt Creation concreted with other ſpecies of natural things, to be of the Nature of the Elements. He that will embrace the firſt opinion, muſt hold that theſe bodies have nobler forms, by which they are more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then the Elements, and from which other qualities flow that are not in the Elements:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exercit.</hi> 307. <hi>ſect.</hi> 20.</note> ſo that is true of <hi>Scaliger.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For ſay they, bodies being adorned with the ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of ſeeds, and clothed with comelineſs, repreſent the image of light; but when they wither and looſe the vigor of their ſeeds, they are covered with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore are called dark.</hi> And <hi>Severinus</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Operations are by mechanick Spirits, which being not armed with knowledg, are diſperſed into naked vapors and ſmoak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They aſſign three kinds of generation to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior globe, namely <hi>of Animals, Vegetables and Minerals.</hi> They ſay that in Animals there is a ſeminal matter, <hi>in the animal Balſom, the vital Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, in the vital Spirit and Mummy,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in man. Perfect creatures beget, and are begotten onely of their own proper ſeeds. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from ſeed and putrefaction, as Mice. But Plants have a thicker body, more ſlimy, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the ſeed of Animals, and in them ſome parts reſemble the teſticles or ſtones, by which the ſeed is prepared more perfect, and more ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept, and ſuch parts by that do propagate the ſeminal matter. Hence it is that ſome plants pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate by their ſeed, others by their roots, others by other waies.</p>
               <p>They make the generation of Minerals much different from the former. <hi>Their ſeeds and ſpecies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flouriſh in the ſeminal reaſons of the matter, and are kept in the Night of</hi> Orpheus, <hi>and the Hell of</hi> Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates, <hi>or the Iliaſtrum of</hi> Paracelſus, <hi>and there
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:171520:39"/>they expect their fate which is deſtinated, and at times appointed, they enter into the world with vital Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and mechanick Spirits.</hi> They deny not life to be in Minerals, but prove it to be from the times of maturity, from the fixed Periods of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſms, by orderly running of the veins from the agreeable compoſitions of their bodies, from their taſt and colour. Alſo they acknowledg no greater art in living forms, then what is in the variety of their colour, ſcent and taſt, and that the colour of a Saphire, and hardneſs of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond are as wonderful as the organs of a Bat.</p>
               <p>As for the upper Globe, <hi>there are in it certain diſtinct generations. For in the Celeſtial Elements</hi> (they ſay) <hi>there are perfect Individuals that laſt with admirable vigor. And that they flouriſh with aboundance of vital ſpirit, which being fermented to a due exaltation and maturity, go into the air with a ſpiritual inviſible, but abundant fertility; and having acquired bodies as fit garments, they produce their fruits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſay ſome Stars are made to produce winds, ſome Eaſtern, ſome Weſtern, ſome Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, ſome Northern. And theſe Stars have not only the firſt qualities, but other vertues and properties. And that there are Stars for rain, hail, ſnow, lightning, fair weather, and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Meteors. That every month the Moon by a new generation produceth fruits, and that there are vital principles of generation in the air, that at appointed times are hot with the diſpenſation of their fruits.</p>
               <p>They deny that the change of times are from the lower or higher poſition of the Sun, or from the obliquity of its beams, or from the direct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of them: but they ſay ſome Stars are for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:171520:39"/>Summer, others for Winter. The Sun is the chief Summer ſtar, but if it ſhould be without the reſt, there would be a perpetual Winter. That the Moon is the chief Winter-ſtar, and that the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-ſtars do ſpring up as plants in the Spring, and die again. And that as Trees are not every year alike fruitful,
<note place="margin">In lib. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teo.</note> ſo thoſe Stars are ſomtimes barren, ſomtimes fertile. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> makes <hi>the like generation of Winds, Rain, Snow, Lightning, Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Rain-bow, and the Morning, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is their opinion of generation, and they make a mixture accordingly: they ſay the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of mixture is <hi>a vital Principle, adorned with Knowledg</hi> by the power of which, the Divine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of mixture are performed.
<note place="margin">Severinus.</note>
               </p>
               <p>They ſay that Tranſplantation is an accident of generation, as the faculty of the ſeed is ſtrong or weak, and as the ſpirits of ſeeds are ſubject. That tranſplantations are ſeldom in perfect crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and not in any but ſuch as are alike in ſeed and Nature; as Wolves and Dogs may mingle. Horſes and Aſſes: but in ſuch as the difference of Sexes is not apparent, there are uſual Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantations. They ſay that in Vegetables and Minerals, Tranſplantations are companions of generation; ſo Calamints turns into Mints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſeed is equivocal: ſo there is the form of Darnel in Wheat, but as a ſervant or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which if it get outward, aid will turn Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and bring in its own ſignatures. See <hi>Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> for more of this.</p>
               <p>Of all theſe we thus think. When they ſay that generation is the progreſſion of ſeeds from their fountain and abyſs into the ſtage of the World, they tell us no news, for it is the opinion of the moſt ancient Greeks, not only of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> but
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:171520:40"/>of <hi>Hermes Treſmegiſtus, Dionyſius, Aropagita, Apollonius, Thyaneus.</hi> And this error came from their ignorance of the Worlds Creation, from which every thing hath its Nature and Being. Therefore they ſuppoſed that all things came forth into light from night, hell, and an inviſible abyſs, and returned thither again. But the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture teacheth otherwiſe,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.</note> for God ſaid, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth fruit. The herb that brings ſeed, and the Tree fruit after their kind, and it was ſo. Let the Water bring forth living creeping things, and let the Birds flie over the Earth in the air. Let the Earth produce Creatures after their kinds, beaſts and creeping things, and it was ſo.</hi> And that God bleſſed the Creation, ſaying: <hi>Increaſe and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply.</hi> Hence it appears that God by his power created the kinds of all natural things, and gave them their forms and bodies. He that made the Elements, mixed them according to his Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and joyned them with thoſe cloſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Thus all things are multiplied by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine bleſſing, and preſerved to this time, ſo that the ſpecies of Plants and all living Creatures are only in their Individuals. God at the Creation gave forms to all things, and made them not of the Elements, as ſome modern Writers ſay, that know nothing but the Elements.</p>
               <p>Therefore the forms of things come not from an abyſs, and take fit bodies by their Mechanick ſpirits, but God in the Creation gave every thing its form,

                  </note> which multiply by his bleſſing. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinions are bawbles, like the gate by which <hi>Aeneas</hi> came from Hell. <hi>Libavius</hi> and <hi>Eraſtus</hi> have written at large againſt them.</p>
               <p>What they ſay of the ſuperior Globe, and its fruits, and generations, is abſurd and ridiculous,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:171520:40"/>againſt both reaſon and experience, the Stories of <hi>Lucian</hi> are more probable; and <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſaith right of <hi>Paracelſus. The Principle upon which all his Doctrine of Meteors ſtands, beſides its prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt Scriptures, is ſo fooliſh and ſimple, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and ridiculous, and falſe, that a man cannot without fear of diſgrace, rehearſe them, or ſpeak of the confutation of them among wiſe men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What they ſay of the generation of Plants and Animals, may agree with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> if they would allow that the ſpecies came not from an abyſs or <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Hell, but the propagation came from ſeeds; as that corporal things are made of incorporeal, and incorporeal of corporal. For they differ rather in words then ſenſe from <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> becauſe ſpirits ſomtimes are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed into bodies, and bodies are turned into ſpirits, when vital and animal ſpirits are made of blood.</p>
               <p>Their Doctrine of Tranſplantation, is not to be diſallowed altogether, for it is probable by many things in Nature, that the ſame form may be in a divers body, or many forms, may be in one ſeed, but ſubordinate, ſo that one be chief, the other ſervants, as appears in the ſilk-worm: but every worm doth not breed from every plant and the forms of ſuch worms are ſubordinate to the forms of the Plants and other Animals.

               <p>Some flie to an equivocal generation and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:171520:41"/>therefore it is queſtionable whether there be any generation truly equivocal, without any ſeed? Therefore conſider that for the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of all Plants and Animals, there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite an inbred matter rightly diſpoſed, by which the form may propagate it ſelf, but this prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of matter is greater in ſome then others. Moſt of the perfect Animals are generated from the womb by the mixture of the male and female ſeed. Others lay eggs from which by heat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, the chickens are hatched. In ignobler Creatures and Plants, generation is not tied to ſuch ſtraight conditions. Some Plants onely by ſeeds ſown in the earth do grow; others by the roots onely planted, others both waies, others by ſlips and ſiences. In ſome the ſeminal humor is throughout the whole plant, ſo that any branch or root being taken off, and ſet in the earth, they will grow as Willows and Vines. I heard from a credible perſon that from the foam of a mad Dog cleaving to a garment, there aroſe little creatures like Dogs. For this ſeminal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ignoble things, lies long hidden in a tough clammy matter, and reſiſts external inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and impreſſions, and at length gets up and acteth. Let this ſeed be called Analogical, if not Univocal, ſo long as the thing generated be not from putrefaction only.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is not againſt reaſon and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence altogether that ſome ſeeds are ambiguous, and have many forms, ſo that one be chief, the other ſubſervient, or that ſome ſeeds are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to divers forms, as appears in ſilk-worms.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Averroes</hi> and his Diſciples ſpeak againſt reaſon, ſaying that Animals from putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, are different in ſpecies, from thoſe that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:171520:41"/>are from ſeed, for they are not wholly deſtitute of ſeed, nor can putrefaction alone produce any creature.</p>
               <p>Since then no generation is without mixture, things do not ariſe from a contention between the Elements, but in the firſt Creation every thing receaved from God, not only its proper form, but alſo a body fitted thereunto, and they keep this their Nature by the wil and bleſſing of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the laſt. Therefore in the propagation of things, a ſpecifick form is required, which the concourſe of Elements, and that raſh mixture cannot make. Therefore the form and ſoul is the architect, and the firſt mover of every thing in mixture is that ſoul and form. The common operator and inſtrument of Nature to nouriſh the vertues of things, is the innate and imbred heat and ſpirit: but the operator of mixture is the Divine command which was given to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements in the Creation, namely that they ſhould agree exactly among themſelves for the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every particular, as <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſaith, but he had ſaid better, if he had ſaid that convenient matter had been attracted (from the Divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) by the vegetative ſoul of every creature: for ſince natural things are not onely firſt produced in the Creation, but ſtil mixed by the viciſſitudes of generation and corruption, he ſhould have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that ſtill in generation of things, all things are directed by the form, not by the mixture of Elements that agree for the conſtitution of every thing. For the forms are the Divine and unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable Principle, that determines all the actions and paſſions of natural things, and they are as the inſtrument or hand of the wiſe Creator that gave them that efficacy at the firſt Creation,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:171520:42"/>then which nothing can be more wonderful.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered, is whether alwaies in the generation of things, there be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to the firſt Elements, ſo that nothing is mixed but the Elements? And whether no ſour, ſalt or bitter things be mixed?
<note place="margin">Lib. de priſca medicina.</note> 
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes, <hi>That a ſalt and ſharp humor is made thick by concoction and mixture.</hi> And this is ſo certain, that even Vegetables partake of the Nature of Minerals, as you may ſee in the Leaves of Oak and Bayberries, Pomegranate peels green, which dye a black colour from the Vitriol that is in them: ſo that the Chymiſts offer to draw Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol from green Walnut-ſhells.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it may be doubted whether the firſt qualities are immediately cauſes of mixtures? For the force of hidden qualities is ſuch, to alter a body, and of the ſpirits, that they may not be excluded. The Works of the Chymiſts ſhew this, for when the ſpirit of Vitriol and Tartar are mixed, there is preſently a great change, and they that have written ſo much for the firſt qualities, dare not bring all the qualities of mixture from the firſt qualities, to which <hi>Eraſtus</hi> aſcribes all, except poſition, number and figure, and the like.</p>
               <p>Alſo we may doubt whether all other affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mixture, beſides conformation, may be referred to cold and heat? But there are many affections in mixture, which cannot be drawn from the firſt qualities; and leſt any ſhould flie to the ſoul, the Loadſtone draws iron; Rhubarb purgeth choler; but this comes not in the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone from the form or ſoul.</p>
               <p>The Philoſophers diſpute much of the Nature of mixture, and how the Elements remain in a mixture.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exercit.</hi> 10.</note> I confeſs I am of <hi>Scaligers</hi> judgment,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:171520:42"/>who defines mixture <hi>to be the motion of the leaſt bodies to a mutual contraction to make an union.</hi> For to the Nature of mixture it is requiſite, that by it a body be made one, not only by continuation, but by the form. But it is very hard in this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man, to ſee how the union of the ſmalleſt things is made, whether by breaking or mixture, or whether they be quite aboliſhed. I think it fit that in mixture, that the things mixed, being u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited in ſmall parts, ſhould act, and ſuffer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by contrary qualities, but not looſe their forms wholly (which if they be aboliſhed, there would not be an union of things mixable, being changed, but a corruption) but that one form is made of all, or rather all being mixed, and made one, abide under the Dominion of one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior form, from which it is a ſpecies. I leave it to others to diſpute whether the forms remain whole, or are broken: this is certain, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mixed body may be changed into that of which it was firſt made; and therefore the forms of the Elements are not aboliſhed, otherwiſe in reſolution or putrefaction there would be a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of new Elements. Notwithſtanding we muſt not think that the ſpecifical form of every thing that gives its name and being, comes from the Elements only: for there is in every natural thing a more Divine Principle and Nature, by which they are what they are, and belong to ſuch a ſpecies. The Elements are only the matter of bodies, and therefore cannot give the act or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This is the old opinion of the Ancients, and chiefly of <hi>Democritus</hi> that ſaid all things were made of atomes.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Epiſt. c.</hi> 1.</note> Nor can we think that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Interpreter of the World (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls him) thought abſurdly of atomes and the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:171520:43"/>generation of things, as we ſhewed at large in our <hi>Hypomnema</hi> 3. For the ancient Philoſophers gave their opinions in dark ſentences, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Adverſaries thought they ſaid what they never thought, and diſputed Logically a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Democritus,</hi> who would have been perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by natural reaſon as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>De gen. &amp; cor. c.</hi> 20.</note> for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is brought againſt the opinion of Atomes, is not Phyſical but Mathematical, as that of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuities, of lines not to be cut, and the like. For <hi>Domocritus</hi> ſaith atomes are bodies, nor doth he deny in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the proprieties of Mathematical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, nor by them doth he take off the Natural or Phyſical proprieties: and when he ſaies, <hi>That generation is by the concretion of thoſe little bodies</hi> he denies not mixture, but only will have either the Elements not to penetrate themſelves, or that we muſt not diſpute mixture flie alwaies to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and firſt matter; but that of ſmall bodies mixed before, and conſtituted in their eſſence, new mixtures may be made.
<note place="margin">Lib. de priſc. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic.</note> 
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> taught this when he wrote, that not only Elements, but ſalt, bitter, and four were mixed.</p>
               <p>Now let us conſider, if ſuch be the Nature, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of generation or corruption. For when any thing putrefies or is burnt, a ſmoak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth, which the ſight at a diſtance takes to be a continued body, but it is many thouſands of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes confuſed as judgment ſhews. Chymical operations ſhew the ſame, eſpecially ſublimation, where theſe atomes are gathered together in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lembick. You may ſee the ſame in Spaws &amp; ſharp waters, where there are as it were Ice-ſickles, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the water that flows from the pipe is very clear; and how can ſo thick a body be from ſo clear a water? In ſuch Mineral waters the ſtony matter
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:171520:43"/>was reſolved into the ſmalleſt bodies, which by meeting together, make a hard body. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly digeſtions and concoctions in Plants and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals is only a reſolution of bodies to be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a concretion of them again, for the uſe of Nature of every one: but the ſuperior form directs all by the inſtrument of heat.</p>
               <p>And here ſince we ſpake of reſolution and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, let us ſpeak of fixation and flying away uſually in Chymiſtry, as it is ſaid. <hi>Make that which is fixed, volatile, and that which is volatile, fixed, and you have the whole matter;</hi> this is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good in Phyſick, when the ſame thing being volatile is poyſon, and being fixed, doth no hurt but is a ſafe medicine, as <hi>Antimony, Mercury, Arſenick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is fixed which holds in the fire, that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile which endures it not, but flies up by heat, and fixation and flying differ from coagulation and rarefaction, though they are ſomtimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. That is coagulated, which from a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual thin body, becomes thick and touchable, which every fixed body is not. A rarefied reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved body is, that which from a touchable thick body, becomes ſpiritual and ſubtile: for Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts can make bodies of ſpirits and ſpirits of bodies.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a difference of mixed bodies, ſome are ſimply fixed, as gold that flies not with the fire, but grows finer by it and better. Others are fixed reſpectively in compariſon of ſpirits, ſuch as in a gentle fire are fixed, but fly in a ſtrong, as iron. Of this we ſhall ſpeak at large, when we ſhew how to fix.</p>

               <p>He makes ſix kinds of Magick. The firſt is,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib</hi> 1. <hi>phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſ. ſagac. c.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>the Interpretation of preternatural ſigns ſuch was the Interpretation of the Star that brought the Magician or Wiſemen from the</hi> Eaſt <hi>to</hi> Judaea: <hi>and to this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the Interpretation of the Prophets and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond kind is, <hi>the Transformation of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:171520:45"/>creatures, as was in the time of</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh.</p>
               <p>By the third, <hi>are made words, which have all ſtrength, and whatſoever a Phyſitian can do by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, may be done by words.</hi> This kind of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick he calls <hi>Characteral.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the fourth he ſhews how to make <hi>Hama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyes, that is, Images and Sculptures, upon which the ſtrength of the Heavens is impreſſed, and which do all things which inſtruments made of Natural things can perform,</hi> as a key opens a lock, or a ſword wounds.</p>
               <p>The fifth ſort is, <hi>when images are made like the people for whom they are, and whatſoever is done to them, they ſuffer whoſe pictures they are, and he ſaith that in an image of wax, any may be roaſted, made blind, wounded, or have a Palſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt kind he ſaith is <hi>Cabaliſtical,</hi> now the Cabal among the Ancients was a kind of Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Symbolical and Aenigmatical Divinity, and the Cabaliſts did believe the Tradition of their Anceſtors, and examined no opinions. This was threefold. The firſt <hi>was that by which</hi> Adam <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the Knowledg he had from God to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> The ſecond <hi>was that by which God explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Law to</hi> Moſes <hi>in Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>when he was with him forty daies, and by which he again taught</hi> Joſhua. The third was invented by the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, <hi>who turned the letters and ſyllables into num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> and brought hidden meanings out of them.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſpeaks not of this <hi>Cabal</hi> who calls the Jews ſtupid Aſſes.

               <p>He ſaith this <hi>Cabaliſtical Magick ſtands upon three pillars; the firſt upon the prayer in ſpirit and truth, when there is Union with God in the Holy of Holies and the created Spirit: where God is worſhiped by a ſacred ſilence. The ſecond is Faith,</hi> not ſaving, but natural, as he calls it, which is that wiſdom which is equally given to all men at the firſt Creation, which is common to men and Devils,

                  </note> this he calls <hi>enchanting Faith.

And though <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi> ſeems to condemn that infamous Magick which is from the Devil, and to commend that which is natural and lawful, yet you may know by what hath been ſaid alleadged, and from his Writings what he followed.
<note place="margin">Lib. prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio ſeu. de myſte.</note> Eſpecially by his upholding that infamous Conjurer <hi>Judaeus Tec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hel,</hi> and there was ſcarce any Magician in any age but he commends him. He ſaith the Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had their Art from God, and is offended that the Scripture gives them ſuch harſh language. From whence, and from many other arguments, it is manifeſt that his Magick was from the Devil. And he makes only this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between lawful and unlawful Magick, that one doth flatter the Devil by Incantations &amp; ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. And the other by force commands his Arts, and makes him ſerve by faith and ſtrong imagination: yet it is never lawful to ask any things of the Devil, or expect his help. Nor is there any Example in Scripture that ever the Devil did any man good. Certainly <hi>Crollius</hi> is very wicked in ſaying, <hi>That true prayers in ſpirit and truth, are the foundation of Cabaliſtical Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.</hi> For prayers are the worſhip of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the 5. of <hi>John,</hi> and they muſt be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his promiſes and will, and this worſhip ought not to be prophaned with ſuch wicked Speeches.</p>
               <p>Now that natural ſaith he ſpeaks of, which is a power to do miracles, and given equally to all men in the Creation, is a meer lye. For true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:171520:46"/>onely belong to the Church; and thoſe done by Infidels and Conjurers, are from the Devil, and are not true, but lying wonders.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Crollius</hi> writes of Imagination,
<note place="margin">In Praefat. admonit.</note> are dreams of Enthuſiaſts: none deny but there is great force in imagination, but that it can do what <hi>Crollius</hi> mentions, it is a meer fable; and if <hi>Crollius</hi> could have cured diſeaſes by imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, why did he ſpend ſo much time in prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chymical medicines.</p>
               <p>In a word, concerning <hi>Crollius</hi> his Magick, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it, there is knavery in the Baker, and under the honey of Chymical medicines, there is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous gall. Therefore beware leaſt under the pretence of Natural Magick, and Divine Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and light of Nature, you do not uſe Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Magick which may be, though you make no contract with the Devil: for it may be made not only explicitely, but implicitely. An expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite contract is, when one makes a Covenant with the Devil. An implicite is, when any uſeth ſuch means with another who hath contracted with the Devil explicitely, and plainly hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſed.</p>
               <p>For though there are examples in Scripture that the Apoſtles ruled over the Devil, and caſt him out, yet there is no example, that any Saint uſed the help of the Devil for a good end to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit man. And though it may be objected for <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus,</hi> that it is no inconvenience for any to get better medicines then are known from the Devil, to cure incurable diſeaſes: yet I ſuppoſe it is neither ſafe nor religious, and St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> ſaies well, <hi>That a man had better die, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover by ſuch remedies.</hi> God that wounded can heal, therefore ſeek help from him alone.

               <p>Moreover, the means in Magick are not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary nor natural, as you may ſee in <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> but are words, characters, waxed images, and ſuperſtitious inventions of the Devil. And that we may not uſe ſuch ſuperſtitions that are ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to have an occult contract from the Devil, obſerve what follows. For where there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miracle nor force of Nature, nor Arts inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, there is a contract with the Devil, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was that made it. And when characters and unknown words are uſed, that are obſcure, and do not cohere or agree, or are holy, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to another meaning, or when Ceremonies of no force are uſed, or the like, there is a ſtrong ſuſpicion.

               </head>
               <p>BEcauſe <hi>the effects of Natural Magick</hi> ſeem to the Paracelſians to depend upon Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not onely to cauſe diſeaſes, but to cure them, and they ſhew wonders done by imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Philoſophers and Phyſitians: we ſhal here ſhew what the ſtrength of it is.</p>
               <p>But note firſt, that thoſe effects which are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to imagination, do not immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it, nor doth the ſoul produce ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects by imagination. For imagination is only a knowing power, that hath an immanent action which goeth not forth to other things, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination doth nothing effectually but know, but the other powers vegetative and moving, do act upon others. And though the phanſie concurs to local motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as knowing it, yet is it not the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cauſe of motion, therefore it doth not act upon any body, of its own or anothers, nor doth it by any ſort of motion alter, move, or change it. But appetite or deſire follows know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and then there is a proſecution or flight
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:171520:48"/>which is by a local motion. Whoſe cauſe is a place moving power diſtinct from the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Therefore the humors are not moved of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or immediately by the imagination, but only by accident, ſtirring up the natural powers, whoſe office is to move the humors and ſpirits to nouriſh the body. The imagination directeth the humors and ſpirits, to move towards this or that part, and it determines the moving faculty, that it may move the ſpirits and humors to this or that part: as when one is laſciviouſly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſpirits and humors go to the privities, by which motion the body is altered, not by the phanſie of it ſelf, nor can the ſpecies of the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie produce a real quality, nor formality make an alteration, becauſe the formal and eſſential rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it is only in repreſentation, and it cannot act beyond its force and perfection. Therefore when ſome are looſe bodied from the conceit of a purging medicine not taken; it is not becauſe the ſpecies of the purging medicine hath a purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force, but becauſe the moving natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is drawn to conſent with the imagination, and ſtirs the humors, which being ſtirred, do provoke the expulſie faculty to ſtool, eſpecially if humors abound.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it moves the deſiring faculty or appetite, and by the paſſions of the mind affects the body: for the paſſions follow knowledg, which cauſeth gladneſs at what is pleaſant, and ſorrow at what is unpleaſant, theſe paſſions have great power to alter the body. But phanſie doth not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately alter the body by the appetite, but as the appetite moves the natural moving faculties in the members, and chiefly in the heart, theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:171520:48"/>moved, do move the humors and ſpirits, and the ſpirits comming and going to the part, do change them. Therefore the remote cauſe of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration is the phanſie, and ſo it affects its own body, and cauſeth divers diſeaſes in it: but of it ſelf it cauſeth none. And if it ſhould, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe would be but imaginary, not real. So ſome melancholick people have thought they had great noſes or bodies, and yet were not ſo.</p>
               <p>And though ſome fall into diſeaſes by imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yet the phanſie doth not of it ſelf, but by accident, by reaſon of fear which moves the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant humors lurking in the body, and theſe being moved, cauſe the plague. One <hi>Vincent</hi> thought his body ſo big, that he could not paſs through the door, and when the Phyſitian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to be carried through, he complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was very much bruiſed, and ſoon after died. But this is not, becauſe the patient ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth, but becauſe he is diſeaſed. And if ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination doth any thing, it is by accident, from ſorrow or fear, and the like paſſions.</p>
               <p>Many diſeaſes come by accident, by means of the ſpirits and humors, as they are different in nature and motion. And imagination being the cauſe of divers paſſions, as anger, ſorrow, much joy, they have ſuch force to corrupt and change humors, that we need not prove it. Moreover, ſtrong imagination draws the ſpirits and humors ſtrongly to the head, and the heat is taken from the parts ordained for nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>Thus imagination may cure diſeaſes, namely, by accident, not of it ſelf, for confidence makes the patient obey orders, becauſe imagination brings paſſions, by which the humors and ſpirits are moved, by which motion they oppoſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:171520:49"/>Therefore confidence begets chearfulneſs, and this ſtirs up the natural heat and ſpirits, and ſo there is better concoction, and the bad humors are overcome, and the diſeaſe oppoſed. Hence it is that they who are alwaies ſad, have many crudities and ſoul humors, from the conſtant loſs of heat and ſpirits. From the ſame cauſe if pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients have ſome meats they longed for, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, though they be not wholſom. And <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> ſaith that the beſt meats,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Aphoriſ.</hi> 38.</note> if not affected, cauſe loathing, and the ſtomach doth not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrace and concoct them, hence come wind and crudities, and the diſeaſe increaſeth, or the patient is longer ſick.</p>

                  </gap>at taken in with pleaſure, ſomtimes cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethe becauſe either by the joy, the ſpirits which were dull by the diſeaſe, are raiſed and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which are the fitteſt inſtrument to conquer ſoul humors and the diſeaſe: or becauſe when then the patient hath his deſire, ceaſeth from that imagination, and the diſeaſe which was falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſed. There are many Hiſtories of this in <hi>Thomas á Vega</hi> and <hi>Alexander Trallian,</hi>

               <p>Therefore if imagination of it ſelf cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict its own body, it cannot change, or hurt any other body. For the ſoul cannot act upon exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, but by means of the body, becauſe the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is an immanent action, not tranſient.</p>
               <p>But by accident it may do ſomwhat, for what is ſaid of Witchcraft, is not to be wholly deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. They ſay the Baſelisk kils a man by the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous beams from his eyes. Theſe come from ſpirits and vapors, by which the occult Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies and contracts of things are. And the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:171520:49"/>may ſomwhat direct theſe ſpirits, as we ſaid by moving the natural faculties, or ſtirring up the paſſions, ſo in envy, hatred, anger, vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous humors which are moved in the body, are carried to the eyes, and flow from thence.</p>
               <p>But a certain diſtance is required, and it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to think that any can be afflicted at many miles diſtance: and it is worſe to aſcribe to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination things beyond its force, and to which it no waies concurs, as when they ſay a man may fall from a horſe by imagination, or corn be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from one field into another.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let us conſider what imagination can do in child-bearing?

               <p>But it is hard to know how imagination could change a child. It is certain, that the phanſie being known, and an immanent power doth not of it ſelf change the child, and the forming fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is the immediate cauſe of quantity, figure, number, poſition and heat, and not the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>Nor is the child changed by a ſpecies of the phanſie, becauſe of it ſelf it cannot produce any real quality, nor hath it any force but to move imagination, and to repreſent to its object; and if this ſpecies had any force, there would be more changes in children.</p>
               <p>It is therefore more probable to reaſon, that the child is changed by the phanſie, either through the paſſions and motions of the ſpirits and humors, or by directing the forming facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:171520:50"/>
               <p>The changes and hurts in children are of two ſorts; common and determinate. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon are abortion, death, inward ſickneſs, and weakneſs, ſmalneſs or greatneſs of ſome part, defect or abundance in number. The determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate are changes and ſignatures which have a determinate ſimilitude to ſome outward thing, as for Example, when they long for Cherries, the impreſſion of a Cherry will be upon the child.</p>
               <p>The firſt changes may be from phanſie, by means of the paſſions and motion of the humors and ſpirits, but the determinate ſignatures which anſwer to external things that are offered to the imagination, cannot be by motion of the humors and ſpirits by the imagination. For the paſſions ſtirs the ſpirits and humors, which ſtirred, are carried with force or in plenty to the child which troubles it, and cauſe abortion by ſtirring up of the expulſive faculty of the womb. Somtimes the forming faculty is diſturbed from the ſame cauſe in its operation, or is overwhelmed, or the ſpirits and humors being ſent another way, the parts are not rightly formed, or they are greater or leſs. But theſe are not determinate faults, nor have they any reſemblance with external things, becauſe they are made by an accidental motion of the humors onely ſtirred by the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and they are not determinated by a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner, according to the ſpecies received in the imagination. Therefore theſe errors are to be attributed rather to the paſſions of the mind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hen to imagination: nor doth the phanſie truly and effectually conduce to them, nor otherwiſe then as it ſtirs up the appetite.</p>
               <p>But when theſe ſignatures are determinated and peculiar according to the ſpecies received
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:171520:50"/>by the imagination, they are aſcribed to the phanſie: nor can the paſſions of the mind of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves produce them, as when Mulberries, Warts, and the like come from the imagination upon the child. And it may fall out that the ſame ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature may be upon the child from divers paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and a woman may bear a child ſomwhat like an Ape, if ſhe either loved an Ape and plaid with it, or was frighted by one, which is a ſign that ſomthing elſe goes with determinate ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, namely the imagination which directs the conformation. For the forming faculty alone immediately makes the whole child, whether well, or ill faſhioned. But the phanſie ſomtimes ſeduceth the forming faculty, and directs it, to make ſuch a thing as is not conformable to the nature of the ſeed but like that which is imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And ſo it is ſaid to be the cauſe of theſe marks concurring to determine them: but this is hard to be explained, and ſome are of another mind. It is ſafeſt to conclude that the forming faculty is directed by the imagination by the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies exemplarily or objectively as they ſay, by objecting the ſpecies conceived, to which as to an example or rule, the forming faculty doth her work. But if any wonder, that the forming fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty which belongs to the vegetative, ſhould know this exemplary ſpecies, let him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that all the faculties in a man, are powers of the ſame ſoul, and have ſome communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among themſelves, although the manner how is not known plainly. Then let him know that the ſoul doth not this by its own power, but a power given by the Creator. And though the knowing faculty differs from the forming, yet they are in ſome things agreable, for ſo all parts
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:171520:51"/>know, and attract the nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>But how the ſpecies being conceived in the brain, ſhould be carried to the womb, is hard to be underſtood. We may ſay that while the child grows to the mother, and partakes of her life, thoſe things that move the powers of the ſoul in the mother, may ſtir up the faculties in the ſeed alſo, and more affect the child then the mother, becauſe her body is ſo perfect, that it needs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but nouriſhment, but the ſoul is ſtill buſie in forming the body of the inſant, therefore any external thing may eaſily be admitted to direct it or ſeduce it to do this or that. Many arguments are for this, ſo as the paſſions of the ſoul are not alwaies neceſſary, but a fixed intention and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is ſufficient to mark the child. The Queen of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> conceived of a white child by only viewing the picture of <hi>Andromeda.</hi> So <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> ſheep marked their lambs by beholding and imagining the party-coloured rods, and we ſee the ſame in other beaſts.</p>
               <p>Theſe changes are in the time of conception and child-bearing, but more uſually when they are gone ſome time, in which time the forming faculty is at work, and buſie to make the parts after conception. But all marks are not made at all times, at the end of the colours may change, and the whole figure, the foot may be like that of a Horſe, the head like a Dog or Hog, in the laſt month this cannot, becauſe all parts are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned. For when Nature hath once faſhioned the child ſhe cannot alter the figure, divide or change the number of parts.</p>
               <p>Nor can the imagination make impreſſion of any changes, but only ſuch as the matter of the body is diſpoſed to, and the forming faculty is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:171520:51"/>apt to make by Natures order: ſhe cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce true feathers, ſcales or horns; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why theſe are rather ſtamped upon the child then the womb, is becauſe the forming faculty is not buſie about the womb, but the child.</p>
               <p>Hence it appears, that the phanſie cannot act upon a ſtrange body, and although the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mother affects the child, yet is it ſo joyned to her, that it ſeems as a part of her. <note place="margin">Avicen. Alchirus. Crol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ius.</note> Therefore they all are out, that think the fancy can affect ſtrange bodies, and they that would ſhew cauſes diſagree among themſelves: <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi> is of their opinion, and heaps one abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity upon another, and give reaſons as weak as the reſt.</p>
               <p>They ſhould have ſhewed that Phantaſmes move another way then by repreſentation, nor doth the phanſie do any thing but receive the ſpecies of things from the ſenſes, to judge and bring them to the underſtanding. And how can the ſpecies and repreſentation that onely are to repreſent the thing from which they came, change or move any thing without a man? Eſpecially ſeeing the action of the phanſie is immanent. And as for the imagination of women with child, and the marks upon their children by the fancy, they only prove that the ſoul any way moved by the imagination, may be the cauſe of peculiar moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in its own body.</p>
               <p>Therefore what <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Crollius</hi> have written concerning the imagination, is not worth the refuting, and to ſpeak ſhort, the foundation of all Magical operations, and the great Wheel of all <hi>Crollius</hi> his Magick is falſe; and it is this opinion of the ſtrength of imagination, and ſew modern Writers follow them.</p>

There are alſo ſpirits in the body which are the principal inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſoul, and the ſoul uſeth them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in the actions of life.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſpirits are inviſible, but corporeal: if the Chymiſts take theſe for the inviſible man, they tell us no news: onely they ſpeak impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, when they give the name of the whole to a part of man. If they mean any thing beſides ſpirits to be the inviſible man, they multiply be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; or they muſt prove that beſides the body, ſoul and ſpirit, there is an other ſubſtance in man; and I ſhall not yeild to them till they do.</p>
               <p>Then in deſcribing the Creation of man, <hi>Crol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> is very raſh; for God by his power created man of clay, and gave him ſtrength as he pleaſed, nor had he need of the Spagyrick Art to give him
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:171520:53"/>ſtrength, and we read that man was made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods image, and we read not that that clay or duſt of which he was made, was the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of the whole World: therefore the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſians are out.</p>
               <p>What they ſay of generation, nouriſhment and rule of mans body, is according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen:</hi> only a little coloured with other fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, yet ſome things are falſe. When they ſay that generation is from mechanical ſpirits, and that after generation the body being compleat, all natural actions are adminiſtred, they ſay true, but it is no news. But they erre in two points. Firſt for rejecting the temperament to be from the firſt qualities, as though it availed not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for an animated part, having its temper and full of natural heat, and ſpirits is the ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate or fit organ for every action: therefore none of theſe muſt be wanting. Then they erre, in that they give knowledg to act, ſimply to the ſpirits, for they act not by their own ſtrength, but are directed by the ſoul, and this knowledg is belonging to the ſoul, which is the firſt cauſe of all actions in a living body.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they think not right concerning blood, when they deny it to be the nouriſhment of the body, and place it above the dignity of the parts: for experience teacheth that the chyle is turned into blood, as the meat into chyle, for no other end, but that the whole body ſhould be nouriſhed with blood. Therefore ſince <hi>Severinus</hi> hath queſtioned ſo plainly a matter, and brought no reaſons againſt it, we may with as much eaſe deny what he ſaies.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, when he ſaith the ſpirits are hungry and filled, it is abſurd; for it is the creatures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:171520:53"/>but the ſpirits are refreſhed and reſtored: it is one thing to indicate, and another to defire. Conſumed ſpirits indicate reſtauration, but the appetite deſires to be preſerved by its like, and to have what is troubleſom removed.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, they make blood one of the parts, and and it may be allowed, but let them underſtand parts as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did when he divided the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into parts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taining contained, and ſuch as do force: otherwiſe blood is no part but nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They do ill to give the government of the body to blood, becauſe it is only for nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but the ſpirits govern the body under the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, they do ill to accuſe the Galeniſts of idleneſs. Nor are they ignorant of that of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> of places in men, which <hi>Severinus</hi> quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor are they ignorant that the diſeaſes in the joynts are worſt, when humors flow from other parts under them. This they call by a new name <hi>Synovia,</hi> and they know not what to determine about it. But <hi>Hippocrates</hi> only attributes that humor to the joynts, that they may move bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paracelſus</hi> thought otherwiſe of <hi>Synovia,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>It is a nouriſhment of its part.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragr. par.</hi> 7</note> And they ſince ſay, it is an internal vertue and agility, or <hi>a ſweet Milk which nouriſheth the parts:</hi> all theſe hang not well together.</p>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>Severinus</hi> doth undeſervedly accuſe <hi>Galen,</hi> becauſe he reckoned not the gall among the parts of the body; for it ought to be caſt out as an excrement, it is ſo far from being a part that conſtitutes a body.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, when <hi>Severinus</hi> makes a ſtomach in the liver and other parts, it is ſimple to quible ſo upon the word Stomach, as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> did when
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:171520:54"/>he ſaid the pleuriſie was in the head. The 10. Chapter of <hi>Severinus</hi> is <hi>Galen</hi> in other words.

               </p>
               <p>The Paracelſians toſs the humors ſtrangely, and ſay they are but bare words, and call the Galeniſts Humoriſts, becauſe ſaith <hi>Paracelſus, Neither Heaven nor Earth knows flegm, choler, or melancholy, therefore they are not in man.</hi> And why ſhould we prove the humors from the Analogy between the great and little World? It is fooliſh without ſenſe or experience, to flie to ſuch Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical proofs. For as in other creatures, ſo in man there is blood which nouriſheth: now ſenſe teacheth that blood is made of meats received, but not Salt, Sulphur or Mercury, and when a vein is opened, blood is let out, not Salt, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur or Mercury; and in all bodies, in all times, ages, places and countries, blood is found. But <hi>Paracelſus</hi> differs in this from himſelf, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions blood and humors in many of his Books.</p>
               <p>But they will anſwer that it is manifeſt to the ſenſes, that blood is in the veins, but they will ſhew by an artificial diſſolving of it, that it hath three Principles, as they ſhew from what foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain actions proceed: but here they ſeem wiſe, for while we ſpeak of blood and humors, the queſtion is not touching the firſt Principles of things, but of the immediate in mans body, and perfect animals. Suppoſe we grant that blood and humors are made of Salt, Sulphur and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, therefore muſt the ancient names of choler, blood, flegm and melancholy be rejected? by the ſame reaſon you may reject the appellations of bones membranes, fleſh, and of all parts: for by the principles of Chymiſts, theſe are made of their three principles as well as blood.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is fit that ancient ſhould be kept,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:171520:54"/>to which <hi>Galen, Hippocrates, Ariſtotle, Avicen, Mefue</hi> and the reſt have agreed, both Chymiſts and others: For it is not for every one to give names to things, nor was <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſo great a man that he ought ſo to do. The names of the humors are not inſignificant without eſſence and properties. Seed, Fleſh and Bone are made of Blood as the reſt, but becauſe they have a new form, they take new names. And that which was before called Bread may be called Chyle, then Blood, Choler or Flegm, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Severinus</hi> is out when he ſaith there is blood in Balſom, with ſpirit, fleſh, bones, ligaments and nerves, and that theſe are ſeperated from it by help of the mechanick ſpirits. There is in all ſood ſomthing familiar to us that turns nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and may have divers forms, as the parts are to which it comes; call it Balſom or Mummy, I am indifferent; but I allow not that the things mentioned ſhould be contained in them, and be only made known and ſeparated by the mechanick ſpirits. Thus we ſhould ſay with <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> that all things are in al things, and there is no true generation. But when chyle is made of bread, blood of chyle, bones, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, fleſh of blood, in every change there is a new form. And every part hath force to turn its nouriſhment into its own nature, which is the peculiar faculty of the vegetative ſoul: what we have ſpoken of blood and humors is meant of alimentary humors that make blood. We ſhall ſpeak of excrementitious humors in the next Chapter, in the Cauſes of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, They make two Anatomies, the one local which they eſteem little, as the diſſecting
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:171520:55"/>of bodies to ſee the ſhape, figure and poſition, and number of parts, this they called a dead A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy for Butchers, by which the Carcaſs is only ſeen, but not the ſecrets of the nature of man.</p>
               <p>The other they cal eſſential, vital, formal, by by which every body is diſſolved into its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

                  </note> he that wil try this muſt firſt know the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſeeds and properties, the offices of the elements, and of the principles, the roots of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and tranſplantation, the laws of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, and the diſpoſition not of the dead but of the whole living body. Therefore they ſay the heart is whereſoever there is vital heat. The Stomach is every cavity or place of conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The womb is every place where there is ſeed of any fruit, and they think the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great world is chiefly to be had in this Anatomy. They ſay whatſoever is in the great world is alſo in man, not according to a ſuperficial likeneſs, but indeed, and according to the ſpecies, and that man contains all things in himſelf, though inviſibly.</p>
               <p>As to the local Anatomy, they ſpeak of, they diſhonor it, for Anatomy is much beyond a Butchers work; for by it all parts are artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally found out, and their conſtitution, and uſe. Thus did <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book of the uſe of parts, and others, which if <hi>Paracelſus</hi> had read, he had not written ſo abſurdly.</p>
               <p>They arrogate to themſelves only <hi>the vital A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy,</hi> but the Galeniſts had it as you may ſee in <hi>Galens</hi> Books of the faculties of nature, of the Seed, of the ſorming of the Infant, of Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, temperaments, Elements, &amp;c. in which he ſpeaks of the faculties of the ſoul which govern
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:171520:55"/>the body, and of the inſtruments thereof in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Yet if the Chymiſts by their Principles can give it more light, we wil accept of it thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. But they here rather quible with words, and with new terms they ſell the opinions of the Ancients as their own, and do little diſcover them, or clear them up; as when they ſay the heart is whereſoever there is vital heat. It is the part of a wiſe Philoſopher to call things by their own names, and not ſo to quible with names as to confound things that are diſtinct.</p>

But <hi>Galen</hi> doth better divide all things that are beſides nature in mans body into three,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 12.</note> that is, the diſeaſe, the cauſe, and the ſymptom, and there is no Diſcipline that makes no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the cauſes and the effects; therfore it muſt be in Phyſick, for the humors are the cauſes, the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:171520:56"/>diſeaſes the effects; and again the ſymptoms are effects of them both, and all theſe differ in their whole eſſence and nature. Therefore <hi>Severinus</hi> writes fooliſhly, ſaying, <hi>That which is moſt remote from producing of an effect, is a genus, that which is neareſt to the individual, is the ſpecies, and the effect is the individual.</hi> He makes the moſt general ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus or kind to be the ſtony tartarous Mucilages in fruits, and thoſe in the ſtomach and guts to be the ſudordinate genus. But when they cauſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and ſymptoms, they are ſpecies; and the laſt actions being hurt or hindered, are the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals. But every true Philoſopher may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this abſurdity. He writes like a fool, when he ſaith he ſaw a feaver vomited forth; for he ſaw the cauſe, but not the feaver. And more ſimply, when he ſaies that matter ſo vomited up, ſhaked for a time like an ague. But either he read not, or obſerved not what <hi>Galen</hi> and Galeniſts have written concerning the ſhaking of feavers.</p>
               <p>But theſe Severinians are offended, that the names of diſeaſes are not given from the cauſes. But they are unreaſonable to think names muſt be given as they pleaſe, and that fit names may be rejected. Therefore it is not bad to define a feaver from its eſſence, then let them enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nature of the cauſe, and whether the cauſe of a feaver may be called Choler or Sulphur.</p>
               <p>Nor do the Galeniſts allows eye the diſeaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but look often more at the cauſe; much leſs do they only obſerve the ſymptoms, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them come often from the ſame cauſe, and one ſomtimes from divers cauſes, and if theſe be not diligently diſting diſhed, he plaies the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, and will be deceived; and if the Chymiſts will help us in curing, we ſhall thank them.</p>

               <p>As for the nature of a diſeaſe, <hi>Paracelſus</hi> errs exceedingly, when he ſaith a diſeaſe is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and that the diſeaſe is a whole man, and hath an inviſible body, and this he ſhews by the Jaundies. But every diſeaſe is nothing elſe but <hi>a quality in the body beſides Nature,

                     </note> by which the body is ſo diſpoſed, that it is unfit for its proper acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Now all error is from this, that as plants come from their ſeeds, ſo they think diſeaſes do alſo; and the true cure of a diſeaſe is nothing elſe but <hi>the taking away of thoſe ſeeds, and if they be not taken away by changing of cold and heat, and ther qualities, and evacuation of humors, no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe can be truly cured.</hi> He illuſtrates this by an Example, as ſaith he, he that labours to keep fruit from growing in his garden, doth not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to pull off the fruit every year, or lop off a branch or two from a Tree, much leſs if he die the leaves or the fruit of another colour, but he muſt take up the Tree by the roots. So to take away heat or cold, and the like qualities by their contraries, is to take away the fruits onely and leave the root.</p>
               <p>Concerning the original of the ſeeds of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they ſay, That though in the firſt Creation when by divine power, the ſeeds took their force to generate and multiply, &amp; all things elſe were without corruption: yet after the Fall, <hi>there came new tinctures by the curſe upon thoſe pure ſeeds</hi> (as <hi>Severinus</hi> ſaith) <hi>by the mixture of which the beauty of the Creation was tranſplanted into a cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous condition, and theſe pure ſeeds were covered with unfortunate new garments</hi> (and he adds) <hi>that man who uſeth all ſublunary things, and lives upon Plants and Animals, is defiled with univerſal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, and hath many ſorts of diſeaſes and deaths.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Severine</hi> brings the riſe of hereditary diſeaſes from hence: ſo that they may be to the fourth Generation. And hence he ſaith is the reaſon why people not having the Gout or Falling-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs beget children that have: For the inbred im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities of the Parent not being ripe in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may be increaſed in the children, and bring unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſymptoms. He ſaith on the contrary that they which have the Gout may beget children that have not. Either becauſe the ſeeds of thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are not fixed in the root and Balſom of man, but cleave only ſuperficially, or becauſe they are overcome in the womb by the power of its natural Balſom, or becauſe the ſeeds grew old and barren, <hi>For</hi> (ſay they) <hi>thoſe ſeeds which are not united in ſpecies, but individuals have their ages, and when their root is exhauſted they are bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and unfruitful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They allow not the firſt qualities to be cauſes of Diſeaſes; and when they are convinced, they ſay they are ſo inconſiderable that they require not the help of a Phyſitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They regard not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Diſeaſes, and ſay they are but a certain hinderance to actions: For they affirm that the deſect of Inſtruments and Figures, and Cavities, and Solution of Continuity come not as Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from Seeds, but they ſay the Diſeaſes of the Similary parts have their ſeeds.</p>
               <p>They ſay humors are but Phanſies,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. med. err. c.</hi> 8.</note> and though <hi>Paracelſus</hi> allow them, yet he denies that they are cauſes of diſeaſes, and ſaith the humors come from diſeaſes, not diſeaſes from humors. But many of theſe opinions are not to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for in the generation of diſeaſes it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for the good humors are altered, corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and infected from the bad, as from Leaven,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:171520:57"/>and do hurt the parts, and bring preternatural qualities. But we cannot find any forming force in the cauſes of diſeaſes, as in the ſeeds of Plants which may produce ſuch a body. And they are like the doting Manichaes when they ſay, <hi>Thoſe ſeeds and evil matters of diſeaſes were made by God.</hi> Firſt they make God the Author and Creator of evil and diſeaſes, as if he had made any ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, which is wicked. <hi>For God ſaw what he had made, and they were very good;</hi> for all ſubſtance as a ſubſtance is good, and evil is not conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially but accidentally joyned unto it.</p>
               <p>Then they make a double creation, the firſt which was by the bleſſing of God in ſix daies, the other was by the curſe of God upon the pure ſeeds and roots of things, by which the evil roots of Diſeaſes and Death were added. But God reſted from all his labour the ſeventh day, and the Curſe of God only declared puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Severine</hi> doth ill in bringing hereditary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes from ſeeds. It is true, that the diſeaſes of Parents come to the children by the ſeed and mothers blood; but an hereditary evil is a viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſition in ſome part by which in time, humors of the ſame kind are gathered, and ſo produce the like diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>It is againſt experience to leave the firſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities out of diſeaſes and their cauſes, for all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have allowed them: for as ſoon as any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural diſtemper is in any part all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that its actions are hurt, nor can it do its duty till the natural temper be reſtored;

Yet it is not unfit that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of ſtrong corroding humors, which are divers, ſhould be diſtinguiſhed with names ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from Sulphur or Salt, when there appears any remarkable exceſs of any one humor. For <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls a defluxion from the head,
<note place="margin">4. <hi>De rat. vic. in acu. ſent.</hi> 31. <hi>Lib. de vee Medici.</hi>
                  </note> hot and nitrous, and writes, <hi>That men are not only fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voriſh from heat alone, nor can that alone cauſe a diſeaſe, but bitterneſs and heat, and ſharpneſs or ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with heat, and the like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it ſtrange, that ſuch things ſhould be in the body, when a man is fed with Plants, and Animals which are nouriſhed with plants, and theſe have from the earth their nouriſhment, which contains in it ſalt, bitter, and the like juy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Mineral ſpirits, which are derived into man, whoſe altering force changeth them as much as it can, but they can never be overcome by our nature. Nature indeed labors to void them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfit for nouriſhment: and if they be retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſeparated from the good blood, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide alone, they hurt the body divers waies. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> and other Phyſitians own this, who mention
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:171520:59"/>ſalt and nitrous humors, and the effects of Salt are manifeſt in Catarrhs or Defluxions. Some humors are called Aeruginous, not that they are like Verdigreece as <hi>Eraſtus</hi> thinks, but becauſe there is the taſt and force of corroding, as in Verdigreece and other qualities.</p>
               <p>Nor is it unprofitable to obſerve theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of humors, for they are of concernment for cures; therefore there being great difference of humors, as to their colours, taſt, conſiſtence, and eſſence, and they cannot be called at by the ſame name. If the Chymiſts can here help us, there is no cauſe why we ſhould not obſerve them, yet we muſt not caſt off the old names of the humors: for Rhubarb doth alwaies purge choler, not Salt or Sulphur.</p>
               <p>The Chymiſts ſpeak diverſly of the differences of diſeaſes;
<note place="margin">In laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. medic. arr.</note> 
                  <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſaich, that there are two kinds of ſeeds, the <hi>Iliaſtrum, Cagaſtrum.</hi> The <hi>Iliaſtrum</hi> is when the feed of the diſeaſe is from the beginning, as of Apples, Pears, Nuts. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſtrum</hi> is that which is from corruption. The diſeaſes from the <hi>Iliaſtrum</hi> are the Dropſie, Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Gout, &amp;c. Of the <hi>Cagaſtrum,</hi> Plague, Feavers, Pleuriſies, But as I ſaid, diſeaſes do not ſpring up from ſeeds, but from preternatural cauſes in the body, either bred therein, or gathered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paracelſus</hi> hath another difference, by which he conſtituteth five Beings of diſeaſes. Firſt, the <hi>Ens or Being of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miro.</note> for he ſaith ſome diſeaſes come from God. The ſecond being is an <hi>Aſtral Ens,</hi> under which he comprehends not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes from the Stars of Heaven, but ſuch as come from the ſtars in Man that depend upon the ſtars of Heaven. The third is a <hi>Natural Being,</hi> when a diſeaſe by a fault in Nature, and they conſider
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:171520:59"/>Nature by their three Principles. The fourth is a <hi>Mental Ens,</hi> under which are comprehended all diſeaſes from imagination in our ſelves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and under this they comprehend Incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.

               <p>Here <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſhews his ignorance in Logick and Philoſophy, and he never learned from the Metaphyſicks what Ens or a Being is. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly to ſay that any diſeaſe is from a Being of God. And he ſpeaks improperly in all the reſt of his differences. But we may bear with impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpeeches, ſo good things be under them.

               <p>What <hi>Severine</hi> ſaith of the diſeaſe and fruits of the ſuperior Globe, hath many abſurdities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they are explained otherwiſe then the words ſound.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:171520:60"/>ſpirits that we attract and breath in.

               </p>
               <p>The beſt diſtinction of the Chymiſts, is that from the three principles and cauſes of diſeaſes, if they would be conſtant therein, or explain
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:171520:60"/>themſelves, for the matter is very intricate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Mercury. For if they ſay every humor is not Mercury, but the firſt and ſubſtantial hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor which gives ſenſe and motion to all parts, it cannot be the cauſe of diſeaſes. But if Mercury be taken for the cauſe of a diſeaſe, who will ſay that it is an excrement of natural Mercury and flegm. And I ſee not how they can diſtinguiſh it from Tartar (from which <hi>Severine</hi> ſaith Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs do ariſe.)</p>
               <p>The differences of <hi>Salt and Sulphûr</hi> are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, becauſe ſour, bitter and falt matter is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the body, and vomited up.

The differences of <hi>Salts</hi> are plain in divers Ulcers, as in the Scab, Cancer, heat of Urin, and the like.</p>
               <p>To this diviſion belong <hi>tartarous Diſeaſes,</hi> of which they ſpeak often, and many flie to that in time of ignorance; they ſay then the diſeaſe is from <hi>Tartar,</hi> but few explain what <hi>Tartar</hi> is.

                  <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> rails againſt the Galeniſts, becauſe they call tartarous diſeaſes, ſand or the ſtone, becauſe it is a Metaphorical appellation, but in Phyſick we muſt ſpeak properly, and things muſt de de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated from their Nature, which he doth not obſerve. He ſaith the cauſe of this appellation, is becauſe an oyl, and a water, and a tincture, are made of it, which burns the ſick as the Tartar of Hell; therefore if the name be from the likeneſs of Hell fire, it is taken from a ſimilitude, and is not proper.</p>
               <p>Others extend the word <hi>Tartar</hi> larger then that it ſhould be given only to the ſtone, for they call a ſlimy humor by the ſame name, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Colick, corroſions, and divers pains in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:171520:61"/>the ſtomach. Thus they cal divers things by the name of <hi>Tartar,</hi> to which it doth not equally in reaſon belong, and ſo is not proper.</p>
               <p>But to the purpoſe (agreeing about names) let us ſee whether the Chymiſts and Dogmatiſts may be reconciled in this. The Chymiſts have no clear definition of <hi>Tartar.

               </p>
               <p>Some Chymiſts ſeem to agree with the Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, who ſay, <hi>Tartar is a ſtone-making juyce, or a matter by Nature apt to coagulate. And this juyce is drawn from Plants with the nouriſhment, and ſent from Plants into Animals, and then it hurts much when Nature is weak to concoct and void it.</hi> They make four kinds of this Tartarous juyce. <hi>Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, bolare, or like bole, ſandy and ſtony:</hi> and hence come divers diſeaſes in divers parts of the body.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they bring moſt diſeaſes of the ſtomach from Tartarous impurities, when ſuch a matter covers the ſides of the ſtomach, the vital ſpirits are obſtructed, which are the Author of all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral actions: hence comes ſlow concoction, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, loathing, and the like, and as the tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of the Tartarous ſpirits are ſtronger to wholly overcome the inbred ſpirits, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows want of concoction and nouriſhment. But if theſe impurities have ſtrange ſpirits with them, they turn the nouriſhment into a ſtrange nature, and there is belching and ſtink, and if they have vomiting properties, as of Hellebore or Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:171520:61"/>they cauſe loathing and vomiting. If they have the tinctures of Salts, there is burning of the ſtomach, gnawing, and the like. If of vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Salt, there is a Dog-like appetite.</p>
               <p>Let us grant all this, that we be not ſo unjuſt againſt the Chymiſts as <hi>Eraſtus.</hi>

                  </note> Yet this tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous matter is not the onely cauſe of the hurt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the ſtomach, for a hot or a cold diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per often hurts it. Moreover, from the opinion of <hi>Severine</hi> diſeaſes breed from thoſe tartarous impurities mixed or alone; from the mixed come ſulphurous ſtinking diſeaſes, thirſt, heat, bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mouth, headach, with cold and ſhaking, called ordinary feavers. But he thinks they come rather from their roots, which are Niter with Sulphur. Becauſe he ſaith feavers have ſeeds and roots, in which ſlimy and ſalt ſpirits with Niter, are mixed with impure, ſtinking, diſſolved Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur. Therefore at ſet times when the mineral or matter of the diſeaſe begins to ſpring, being nitrous Sulphur, there is horror, chilneſs, pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the like, as the nitrous Sulphur dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.</p>
               <p>As we are not in this enemies to them, ſo let them be milder againſt the opinions of Galeniſts for firſt we muſt diſtinguiſh the ſeaver from the cauſe. The cauſe is that matter which they call Nitrous Sulphur, from the acceſſion of which there is a hot diſtemper in the whole body, by which all the parts are unfit for their offices, and this preternatural diſpoſition is called a feaver. Nor muſt the name of humors be rejected, for Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Sulphur are never vomited up, or purged forth, or ſweat out, but only humors. Though we grant that the humors are ſet on fire by Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, we will not therefore reject the name of humors.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:171520:62"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scheunemamnus</hi> his opinion of the original of feavers is ridiculous, he ſaith that a globe or bal of many Sphaeres, like a Bezoar-ſtone, is bred in the ſtomach or liver, and thence come ſeavers and fits; and when this ball is ſtruck from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it flames and ſmoaks, and infects the air, hence comes a little cold and trembling, and then heat. But this globe and its circles of which it is made, ought to be very great, becauſe he writes that the patient ſhall have ſo many fits as are circles in it.</p>
               <p>Againſt <hi>Severine</hi> I ſay the Colick cannot breed from a ſlimy Tartar mixed with ſtiptick, or bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, four ſpirits, becauſe he made one cauſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the pain of the Colick. I agree with him about the name, for the caſe is plain, that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is from glaſs like flegm as <hi>Galen</hi> taught. But if he make that the only cauſe, he errs exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe there are great pains from wind that extends the guts, nor doth ſharpneſs or wind cauſe pains but by ſtretching, which being made to paſs by a Clyſter or two the pain ceaſeth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then by the laborious Chymical medicines. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ideo Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſ.</hi> 13.</note> It is falſe that he ſaith, the ſharpeſt pains are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the ſharpeſt ſpirits of Salts: he calls the pains from cuts, burnings and ſtroaks <hi>Relolls.</hi> But all men living do witneſs by ſenſe, that there is no greater pain then that from cutting and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Severine</hi> proceeds, and ſaies, and deſcribes the generations and differences of inflammations, ſaying, <hi>That the ſeeds of theſe diſeaſes come to the matrixes, not only in a liquid form diſſolved, but in a ſpiritual vapor, and continual nutrication, and dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted fermentation, and except the time of neaturity and ſeparation, which coming, the ſpirits break forth and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:171520:62"/>boyl. And then the ſignatures that lay hid before in the ſpirits are explained colours, taſts, ſcents, heat and other qualities. And by nouriſhment daily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, they make bodies agreable to the principles, mattery, ſlimy, bloody, coagulated, diſſolved, ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, red, black.</hi> He brings the kinds of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations from the proprieties of the ſulphurous ſpirits. And Arſenick ſpirits make plague ſores. Orpiment ſpirits make Pleuriſies, not only in the breaſt, but in the brain, lungs, heart, liver, ſpleen and ſtomach.</p>
               <p>He accuſeth <hi>Galen</hi> and other Doctors for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That inflammations come from much blood, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exerciſe, falls, contuſions.</hi> And denies that theſe effects can come from theſe cauſes, <hi>except ſome Arſenical ſeed cauſe the Plague, or other the Pleuriſie lying in the blood, till it get an occaſion to boyl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the breeding of ulcers, he ſaith thus. <hi>If from the inbred Balſom weakned from error by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate diet in the mummy of the blood, the Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viae of fleſh defect of ſeparation come from impure matter: the impurity being left, which is full of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive ſalts; if this happen often, and then tincture be ſtrong of the corroſive ſeeds, and the mummy of the blood be tranſplanted, they will bring in the roots of the fleſh or Synovia, and by conſtant nouriſhment, from things of like impurity, at a digeſted time they will produce fruit agreable to the roots. He ſaith that ſalts of iron breed the roots and fruits of a Cancer in the fleſh, veins and members, reſembling the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of</hi> Mars, <hi>and they dwell in the face, lips, papps, breaſt, and ſomtimes the womb. The Herpes and Wolf have aeruginous roots, near of kin to the Cancer, and place themſelves in the muſculous fleſh in the joynts and breaſt, &amp;c.</hi> I ſhall not repeat more for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſake.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:171520:63"/>
               <p>But many of theſe are falſe and abſurd. Firſt, he denies the cauſes alledged by the Galeniſts, but every one may ſee them daily, eſpecially if they be in an impure body. Moreover, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations riſe not as plants out of ſeeds, but when bad humors are heaped up in the body, if nature cannot expel them by uſual waies, ſhe ſends them to ignoble places, where, with blood gathered out of the veſſels, they are hot and putrefie: hence comes pain and inflammation, the skin diſcolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to the variety of the humor. And that which Nature doth every where, ſhe doth here alſo, that is, ſhe makes divers quittors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the humor: the ſame is to be thought of the breeding of ulcers. Nor are the Chymiſts to be totally rejected for their explaining of the differences of inflammations and ulcers, though it may be objected againſt them, there are divers effects of <hi>Arſenick, Orpiment, Vitriol,</hi> if they be applied outwardly, by things that appear in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations; for <hi>animal Salt and Sulphur</hi> differ from <hi>vegetable Salt and Sulphur,</hi> and things ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the earth, have a kind of alteration, and the greater in Animals, though they do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wholly change their Nature, as you may ſee in Bubo'es, Carbuncles, Cancers, and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>De loc. att. c.</hi> 9.</note> Concerning the cauſe of pain, they ſay that the ſpirits of Salt diſſolved, cauſeth pain, this we allow, but it is alſo from burning, cutting, ſtretching, as I ſaid. But I take it ill, that he ſhould reprove <hi>Galen,</hi> becauſe he denied that the names of taſts ſhould be applied to pains. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> ſaies right, That every ſenſe hath its proper ſenſible, therefore as colours cannot be perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ears, ſo taſts cannot be apprehended
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:171520:63"/>by the touch, as they are ſuch; yet <hi>Galen</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies not that things that are taſtable, as they are ſalt and ſharp, do diverſly afflict the touching, but this is not from a ſavor as it is taſtable, but as it is ſharp, which may be taſted alſo: which <hi>Severine</hi> confeſſed, therefore he unjuſtly accuſeth <hi>Galen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo it is evident, that differences of pain come from the nerves in the part, being more or fewer. <hi>Severine</hi> ſaies, Thoſe parts are moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in which are the ſharpeſt ſpirits of Salt, which go outwardly at the mouth of the ſtomach, the guts. But he is out, for parts covered with nerves and membranes, have the ſharpeſt pains.</p>

                  <hi>Scheuneman</hi> in his Book called <hi>Reformed Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick or his Hermetical Penny:</hi> laies down <hi>ten chief Cauſes of diſeaſes: as ſpiritual Mercury, burnt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, ſublimate Mercury, praecipitate Mercury, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur coagulated, Salt calcined, Salt diſſolved, and Salt reverberated.</hi> But he ſhews no cauſe of theſe Principles; they are new beings, which he no waies proves, and therefore he uſeth new words, nor plain Greek nor Latin, as <hi>Pneumoſus,</hi> or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Mercury, <hi>Cremoſus,</hi> which is we ſuppoſe from <hi>Cremare</hi> to burn.</p>
               <p>At laſt he propounds an <hi>aetherial Spirit-like fire the governor of all actions, the radical moiſture that bedews the whole body, the ſpirit of the radical humor, the quickning ſubſtance, and immediate inſtrument of actions, the aetherial ſpirit author of concoction and digeſtion.</hi> But theſe being not ſufficient, he adds a fourth, <hi>the moſt pure, white, ſweet pleaſant, pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the cheriſher of the heat of the whole body, &amp;c. which he calls congealed Sulphur,</hi> the firſt moiſture or Virgins milk, that bedews the body, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſheth it, the firſt ſubject of generation, alſo a

               </p>
               <p>But here we admire. He propounds ſo many Spirits and Principles, and proves not in the leaſt whether they are in being, or be ſo many. He brings inflammations from Sulphur congealed and burned; but in the fifth Chapter he brings the Quinzy and Pleuriſie from <hi>Mercury ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> Then he brings Feavers from <hi>Sulphur fired.</hi> So <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> call them by the name of <hi>Fire,</hi> but he mixeth falſe things with them.</p>
               <p>What he ſaies of <hi>diſſolved Sulphur,</hi> is not wholly to be rejected, for the Galeniſts ſay that pleaſant vapors ſent to the brain, cauſe ſleep: nor when he ſaies, <hi>That Narcoticks cauſe ſleep, not from cold, but from Sulphur.</hi> But he errs in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſleep is from a moiſt Nature and ſoft ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that bedews all the parts; for who will ſay that the venemous quality in the Plague which produceth deep ſleep, is ſuch? In that he brings <hi>Fluxes and Dyſenteries from congealed Sulphur and diſſolved;</hi> he differs from other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſians, that ſay they come from <hi>Salt,</hi> which is more probable.</p>
               <p>But he accuſeth the Galeniſts falſe, for ſaying excrements are diſeaſes. For the Paracelſians do ſo, and <hi>Severine</hi> that ſaith he ſaw a Feaver caſt out by vomit. Then he makes diſeaſes of Salt threefold: <hi>calcined, diſſolved and reverberated Salt.</hi> He ſaith the calcined Salt is <hi>the Balſom of life;</hi> and if it melt in the body, it cauſeth Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Oedema and Cachexy.</p>
               <p>He ſaith diſſolved Salt is <hi>a liquid body, of a fat taſt, that coagulateth and aſtringeth, that nouriſheth all with its good reliſh, and preſerves all, and is therefore called the meat and drink of the Gods &amp;c.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:171520:64"/>and whatſoever wants this Salt, is quite unſavory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaith the reverberated Salt, <hi>is the Lixivium or Clenſer of all Nature that takes away filth.</hi> To this Salt he brings the Itch, Scurſe, Morphew, Pox Scurvey.</p>
               <p>Though we diſown not the Salts of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, which the reſolution of bodies ſhews. <hi>Scheuneman</hi> did well in a few things, but adding ſome falſities, he made the reſt ſuſpected. He gives no reaſon why ſo many Salts, nor is it needful that what compounds the body, ſhould cauſe diſeaſes. Moreover, he is not conſtant in deſcribing the kinds of Salts, as appears when he derives all taſts from <hi>calcined Salt,</hi> and that it is now bitter, then ſalt, now four, and then ſweet: yet in another place he brings the taſt from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Salt, &amp; ſaies nothing is ſavory that wants diſſolved Salt. Other Chymiſts are more right, as we have ſhewed in the Chapter of Salts.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he errs much in ſhewing the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Sweat, Cachexy, Dropſie, and the like. That Sweat hath Salt, is not to be denied, but is not only Salt: for in us it ſtinks often, which the Chymiſts ſay is from Sulphur; nor is ſweat a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Salt coming from the ſubſtance of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: we ſometimes allow it to Diaphoretick ſweats, but not to others. But the ſerous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the ſweat, and that ſweat and urin have the ſame matter. And if ſweat were thus made, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers would not be gone with ſweating, which we ſee. It is as abſurd when he brings Cachexy and Dropſie from reſolved Salt, for the Dropſie is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe cauſed, as in <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Pract. Cap.</hi> 1. you may ſee.</p>
               <p>Nor had <hi>Paracelſus</hi> or <hi>Severine</hi> any cauſe to bring the Dropſie from the reſolution of parts or
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:171520:65"/>their Salts, for there is water and Salt enough in our meats and drinks, which if it be not well ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, it breeds a Dropſie by degrees. Nor doth a Scirrhus of the liver or ſpleen alwaies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Dropſie, and never go before it, for expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhews the contrary.</p>
               <p>To what he faies of <hi>Tartar,</hi> I grant that many difeaſes come from Tartar and Salt, or being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed with ſlimy humors But he errs, ſaying that ſuch Salt is the nouriſhment of the body, and the meat and drink of the Gods, and when it doth not its duty, it breeds cartarous diſeaſes. This Tartar is rather an excrement unfit to nouriſh the body,
<note place="margin">Lib. de ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri Medici.</note> as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, and wine which hath little Tartar, is beſt.</p>
               <p>As for his <hi>reverberated Salt,</hi> I commend him for bringing the Itch, Scab, Scurſe, and Teter, and Ulcers that creep, from Salt, and the Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts ſay that ſalt humors cauſe them; but I ſee not what he doth more then others. For theſe diſeaſes differ in their cauſes, &amp; cure very much, and the kind of Salt or ſalt humor is different in a Cancer, and a Teter, or Scab, and if he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained them, he had ſound favor from all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. For there is great difference of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes from ſalt humors and the French pox, the Scurvey, Cancer and Carbuncle differ not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reſpect of the part affected, and the greater or leſſer heat of the ſalt Spirits, or the kinds of Salts, which the beſt Chymiſts confeſs, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they apply divers medicines to divers diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that ariſe from Salts: nor do I believe that <hi>Scheuneman</hi> cured the Leproſie, French pox, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, Teter, Scurvey, and all corroding Ulcers with one only Salt.</p>
               <p>What he ſpeaks beſides, is not conſiderable,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:171520:65"/>and I ſhould looſe time to treat concerning it.</p>

               <p>He ſpeaks nothing in general of Signs, let us conſider what he ſaies in particular, and firſt of the Pulſe. The modern Phyſitians think that he was well skilled in pulſes, as appears in his Book of the Plague Tract. 1. where he ſaith, <hi>The pulſe is the meaſure of the temper of the body, according to the propriety of the ſix places, which the Planets poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, &amp;c.</hi> And wrote more of pulſes,

                  </note> as you may ſee. And he ſaith the pulſe continues till death, and ſomtimes a quarter of an hour after.</p>
               <p>If he had no more to ſay of pulſes, he had but little, and what could be more ſimple, then to write that the gall, reins, liver have their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar pulſes? and the feet and other members, to attribute anger to the pulſe? And that is moſt ſimple when he ſaies, <hi>A pulſe may beat a quarter of an hour after death:</hi> for how can there be vital actions when the ſoul is gone?</p>
               <p>He was larger concerning urin, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:171520:66"/>thus:<hi>It is a ſalt ſeparated from the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſome of the three firſt Principles neglected by Nature, namely the ſtomach, liver and reins ſend forth the urin.</hi> He is not to be deſpiſed for refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring urin to ſalt,

               <p>He divides the urin into <hi>the external, internal,</hi> and <hi>mixed.</hi> The firſt he will have to come from the Elements, and to ſhew no more then what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the ſtomach, reins and liver. And ſaith it is of Tartar, which ſhews that the ſeparation from the pure and the impure, is made in the three chief parts, the ſtomach, liver and reins, and in this urin, Salt, Sulphur and Mercury may be known.</p>
               <p>The <hi>internal urin which is of blood, comes not from the nouriſhment, but from the excrements of all parts, and the Minerals that are in Nature.</hi> He calls that <hi>a mixed urin which is compounded of the internal and external.</hi> But <hi>Paracelſus</hi> did not much regard this diſtinction, as appears in the Life of <hi>Oporinus,</hi> who brought an urin to him, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Doctors opinion, but he brake the glaſs againſt the wall, and called him fool.</p>
               <p>He errs in making the internal urin of blood, not from nouriſhment, but from the excrements of parts and Minerals in mans Nature: for in a part conſtituted, there are no Minerals that ſend forth a peculiar excrement. <hi>John Rhenavus</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions other differences of urin from <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in his <hi>Vrocriterium Chymiatricum,</hi> where you may ſee ſtrange opinions of urin, but let every man beware of them.</p>
               <p>Some Chymiſts have ſpoken well of troubled
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:171520:66"/>urins, but not they alone, nor are they the firſt, for in a troubled urin, many things may be known which are not to be ſeen in a clear, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in feavers; for in ſome ſomthing ſticks ſo to the glaſs, that it is hard to be ſcoured off. In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though it ſtand long, there is none. This is eaſily known when the urinal lies on one ſide: therefore in ſuch diſeaſes I ſuppoſe from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that you may judge as well from troubled as clear urin.</p>
               <p>Some Chymaſts in Epidemick diſeaſes diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh urins from <hi>Arſenick, Orpiment</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</hi> They ſay <hi>Arſenick</hi> is like unſlaked Lime, and cleaves to the urinal, and corrodes it: that <hi>Orpiment</hi> is like Okar in colour, and ſticks faſt alſo, but doth not corrode the glaſs ſo much; that <hi>Mercury</hi> is sky-coloured, and is firſt ſeen in the circle.</p>
               <p>Others teach that you may judg of diſeaſes by diſtilling the urin, but <hi>Paracelſus</hi> tried it not,
<note place="margin">Gerhardus Doraeus de urin. deſt.</note> I ſuppoſe, (but this is my opinion) in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes if any will diſtil it, I am not againſt it, that they may know better what is in it, as you do in Spaw-waters. Whatſoever he ſaies more of the part affected, the diſeaſe and the event, is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh What doth a furnace as high as a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the couſtitution of the urin? Why ſhould the bigneſs of the veſſels in a certain part anſwer to the juſt ſtature of a man? All men are not of one ſtature, and therefore this proportion will not fit all, and you muſt make other furnaces and glaſſes for others: but theſe are trifles.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Severine</hi> thought otherwiſe then <hi>Galen</hi> concerning the place affected, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the times of diſeaſes: but <hi>Severine</hi> jeſteth at the word, and diſtinguiſheth not the diſeaſe from
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:171520:67"/>the cauſe, nor the place from the cauſe, nor the part affected by it ſelf from that by conſent. And he unjuſtly accuſeth <hi>Galen</hi> for making the brain the part affected in an Epilepſie, becauſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of ſenſe and motion, is from the brain: Nor was <hi>Galen</hi> ignorant that the cauſe which twitcheth the brain, and produceth it, was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in the brain: but he willingly taught, and all other Phyſitians after him, that it came often from the womb, ſtomach, and other remote parts, as in other diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>The Galeniſts knew, and taught that the root and fountain of the diſeaſe was to be found out. And it is very hard to find out the part that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords matter to the diſeaſe. Moreover, the way of finding out the ſeeds of diſeaſes, is uncertain, for the relation of the patient (which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſlights) ſhews us ſomtimes beſt to know the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, as for example, in the Epilepſie by conſent from the leg, may be known beſt by the relation of the patient, which cannot be known by giving medicines; let them ſhew it otherwiſe, not by promiſes, and till then, let us retain the old way of finding out the parts affected. And let us not imitate the raſh Chymiſts, who write little of the part affected, and not ſay, <hi>That medicines of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves know how to find the center of a diſeaſe,</hi> which is meer folly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Severine</hi> ſaith, the times and periods of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes come not from numbers, or the peculiar Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, the motion of the Moon, the flux of excrements, and certain motion of the expulſive faculty, but from the ſeeds and ſtars of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and that in diſeaſes, the offices of Nature ceaſe, and all things are governed by the ſeeds of diſeaſes.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:171520:67"/>
               <p>And though it be true, that concoctions and excretions are at certain times, we muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that theſe inferior things are governed by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior cauſes, which the very Countrey-ſwayns know from the motion of the Moon: for all men are equally affected by the ſame coeleſtial influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and motion.</p>
               <p>It is falſe, that hereditary diſeaſes, as Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Gout, and the like, grow like Plants from their ſeeds (as <hi>Severine</hi> writes) which have their time of digeſtion, and bringing forth fruit, ſome in the ſeventh, tenth or fourteenth year, &amp;c. for there is another cauſe which is the vicious diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the parts. And the reaſon why they ſeize not on all at one time, but upon ſome in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, others in youth, is, becauſe the cauſe that produceth. diſeaſes, is not eaſily bred in all ages. The Epilepſie ſeizeth upon infants, the Gout u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon old folk, but commonly the hereditary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe comes at thirty, becauſe that age uſeth to heap up the cauſes of that diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>But it is againſt experience, when <hi>Severine</hi> brings the continuity of diſeaſes from Homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal roots, and the intermiſſion of them from he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneal roots. For the cauſe of continuity and intermiſſion, is divers, as we ſhewed in Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. But this caſt him into many abſurdities by ſuppoſing that diſeaſes ariſe onely as fruit from Trees. He hath many abſurdities, but this is worſt, becauſe in diſeaſes he takes from Nature the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the body: but he ſpeaks contrary to himſelf and to experience. Thus, <hi>It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per faculty of all vital Elements, not to endure any ſtrange thing in their Region, but they expel all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries by force.</hi> Right, for Nature doth not only her duty in health, but in ſickneſs. Therefore
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:171520:68"/>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith well,
<note place="margin">6 <hi>Epid.</hi>
                  </note> that Nature is the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianeſs which is not ment of the Nature of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, as Chymiſts interpret, but of the body. For while Nature oppoſeth a diſeaſe as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, we muſt not deſpair of cure, and the Criſis comes by Natures benefit, which to impute to Medicines, is fooliſh.</p>
               <p>Nor is <hi>Paracelſus</hi> conſtant in Prognoſticks,

               <p>Therefore this is the queſtion, whether all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are curable? Firſt, it is a wonder that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſians ſhould die ſo ſoon, when they defend all diſeaſes to be curable, why do they not prove it in themſelves? The vulgar is governed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and fair promiſes, but not the Learned. Moreover, they erre in counting the Leproſie, Epilepſie, Dropſie and Gout curable, which <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> ſaies are uncurable. For they are not alwaies curable nor uncurable, but ſome are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo, others by accident. Of themſelves they are uncurable, when their Nature is ſuch, that no art of man can help in any patient, and when there never was an example of cure. They are uncurable by accident, when there are remedies, and by Nature they are curable, and in ſome they are cured, though in this or that patient they are not cured, becauſe ſomthing happens which makes it impoſſible. Therefore the Epilepſie, Dropſie and Gout, are not well referred to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes of themſelves uncurable. <hi>Galen</hi> mentions ſome Lepers that were cured with Vipers and Treacle.

               <p>The reaſons they bring for the cure of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, are of no force.

But here he did ill, for all Phyſitians have acknowledged diet to be neceſſary to the cure of all diſeaſes, and he that neglects it, finds it by experience. In feavers it is plain, for if the patient eat too freely, or that which is improper he relapſeth. And in many diſeaſes good diet is half the cure.</p>

               <p>As for Phyſick, let us conſider the univerſal Medicine which the Chymiſts ſo commend, by which a man may be preſerved from diſeaſes to the determinated time of his life, as <hi>Robert Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenſis</hi> writes.
<note place="margin">Lib. de verit. Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miae.</note> This as <hi>Arnold de Vill a nova</hi> faith, <hi>Hath vertue and force above all Medicines, to cure all diſeaſes both hot and cold, becauſe it is of an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and ſubtile Nature, it keeps Nature in health, ſtrengthens its vertues, and makes the old young, and expels all infirmities, &amp;c.</hi> But many Chymiſts think there is no ſuch univerſal Medicine that can cure all diſeaſes in ſimilary and organical parts, in exceſs and defect and in conformation. They confeſs that wounds, fractures, and luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Ruptures, and the like which require Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery, are not ment here. They except alſo the ſtone, hereditary diſeaſes, hecticks, and diſeaſes in number deficient, fixed Cancers and Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grenes, becauſe God alone, not man, can cure all diſeaſes: only they are only curable with this univerſal Medicine that come from the inward fault of the humors, or as they ſay, <hi>Which ſpring from an internal Root.</hi> And they call it a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of much uſe, as the Ancients called it a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Chymiſts brag of this, but few or none have explained it. They ſay it is enough to know the patient to be ſick, and that next to the Word of God, by which eternal life is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there is nothing more precious: but this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is rather to be wiſhed then hoped for; nor was that yet found that hath done that which the Philoſophers ſtone doth in tranſmutation of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, it is plain, and many of our age have had it, but it is not evident what it hath done in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring diſeaſes, nor yet any thing proved by good witneſs.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:171520:69"/>
               <p>If this Philoſophers-ſtone can tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſmute ignoble Metals, yet it follows not that it is an univerſal medicine, for they ſhould firſt prove it upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and others that bragged of the Philoſophers-ſtone, and yet died all young.</p>
               <p>But they which have this univerſal Medicine, and do hide it, have no mercy like Chriſtians, when they ſee ſo many men tormented, and will not help them. Nor are good things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, becauſe they are abuſed. I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Chriſtian Phyſitian can with a ſafe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence conceal a Medicine that can cure great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and if he do, he doth not like a Chriſtian that muſt love his neighbor as himſelf.</p>
               <p>They agree not among themſelves in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating this Medicine, for many take it for the Philoſophers-ſtone, yet <hi>Scheunaman</hi> makes the leaves of black Hellebore almoſt equal to the Philoſophers-ſtone, and ſaith that they being brought into a Balſom, make a man live a ſecond age, and do purge beyond all.</p>
               <p>There are three opinions of the univerſal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. The firſt is of them that think that it cures all diſeaſes, not primarily, but ſecondarily, by ſtrengthening Nature wonderfully, for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Hippocrates, Nature is the Phyſitian,</hi> ſhe concocts, ſeparates, voideth, and takes away all faintneſs. And here the Chymiſts extol their Quinteſſence and Balſom, and their incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vital Sulphur, they call the ſecret flower the Sun and the Heaven. They ſay their Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and aetherial Spirit diffuſed through all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, is the fountain of all vigor and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In Animals it gives ſoul, in Vegetables it gives growth and vegetation, in Minerals and Metals it doth according to them. In men it
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:171520:70"/>makes concoction and Criſis, and then triumphs over his conquered enemy.</p>
               <p>They ſay this Spirit and Quinceſſence and Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomick Medicine, comes from the great World to the leſs, that the ſpirit in the body of man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing helped by external aid, that is by this ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thener, may oppoſe diſeaſes more valiantly, and either change what is foul in the body to a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtate, and expel it. Some ſay this is to be done by Chymiſtry, ſo that it may eaſily agree, and be united to our natural heat, and radical moiſture, and ſpirit, and increaſe it, and raiſe it to the height of purity. And though this quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence be in all things, yet it is more in ſome then in others. And the univerſal Medicine is to be made of that in which this Quinteſſence doth moſt abound, but what, and what kind of matter it is, they do not explain.</p>
               <p>Of this firſt opinion I think thus. Firſt, I admit of what they ſay touching the ſtrength of inbred ſpirit. The Galeniſts teach this, only let us have the ſoul to be the principle agent &amp; this inbred ſpirit,
<note place="margin">

Nor do I wholly reject their Quinteſſence, but admit it ſo as I ſhewed in my Inſtitutions; namely, to be ſomthing like to the Element of the Heavens, a ſpirit ſuch as is in wine, by which it ſo ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens the body, and refreſheth the ſpirits: and by Chymical reſolution you may ſhew it in all plants. And many Galeniſts confeſs that there is in Medicines, not onely that which works by the firſt qualities,

                  </note> but by a nobler force. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſpeaks too raſh to call the Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence a Dream of idle perſons that deſire to cheat.</p>
               <p>But let us grant them this, and that there is
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:171520:70"/>Nature that which abounds with this Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Spirit, which being artificially prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, hath great power to ſtrengthen, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be called an univerſal Medicine. Yet they prove not that it can cure all diſeaſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out purgers, alterers and openers, and the like. And it cannot be that Nature ſhould purge wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a Dropſie, with Medicines that move the belly, or diſcuſs the nodes in the Gout, or the Stone without help of Medicines. And though all diſeaſes ſhould come from the hurt of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſpirit, yet the cauſe of that hurt may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold; therefore to reſtore the ſpirits, divers Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines muſt be given according to the variety of cauſes that hinder it. Therefore it is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that the ſpirit which governs the whole body be ſtrengthened, but the ſtrength of every privat part muſt be preſerved.</p>
               <p>The ſecond opinion is of thoſe that allow not only force to the univerſal Medicine to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the inbred Balſom and Spirit, but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, conſume and diſſipate the ſeminary tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and impurities, or diſeaſes and cauſes thereof. But let us conſider if this may be to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their opinion, they ſay that fire burns all things, Antimony conſumes all Metals mixed with gold, and hurts not that, therefore the ſame may be by the univerſal Medicine, which like a purging fire, conſumes all the impurities of our bodies. Secondly, they ſay as there are poyſons as Arſenick, and that of a mad Dog which hurts all men, ſo there may be Medicines that do all good, and cute all diſeaſes. But theſe do not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. For fire doth not conſume all things, but only combuſtible things, for it doth no hurt to earth or gold. What they ſay of Antimony is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:171520:71"/>not agreable here, nor doth he prove that the ſame thing may be done by the univerſal Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in mans body. Therefore they ſhould prove that ſuch a Medicine may be as may reſiſt all the diſtempers of the body, and conſume all cauſes of diſeaſes, and hurts not the body as Antimony doth all but gold which is ſafe.</p>
               <p>To the ſimilitude of poyſons, I ſay that every poyſon hath its own Nature, and man hath his; therefore it is the action of a determinate thing upon a determinate; nor is every poyſon a poyſo to every creature. And there are many things w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hurt men, &amp; do no hurt to other creatures. But if all diſeaſes are to be cured by a medicine, there would be an univerſal action upon a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, becauſe there are divers diſeaſes and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which have their peculiar nature, all which an univerſal nature ought to reſiſt.</p>
               <p>They who think there is no ſuch univerſal Medicine have ſounder principles. Firſt, the cure of a diſeaſe is a changing of the body into a contrary to the diſeaſe, But all change is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween contraries, and from the contrary. There are many differences of diſeaſes and bad humors. Some diſeaſes are from manifeſt qualities, ſome from occult, and there is a great difference in theſe, as appears by variety of poyſons: and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very diſeaſe and humor requires a peculiar reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor doth one Medicine cure diſeaſes from cold, heat, nor doth it moiſten, and dry, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all poyſons. If they ſay this univerſal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is ſo tempered that it can reſiſt all, how then being ſo tempered in the firſt qualities, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not amend the great exceſs of cold and heat at once. And to ſpeak Chymically, if Sulphur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and Salt be wanting, how can a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:171520:71"/>Medicine, ſupply the defect of Salt, and take away the abundance of Sulphur.</p>
               <p>God therefore alone cures all diſeaſes, but the ſtrength of natural things is determinate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and the medicinal vertue is diſperſed into many things; nor is their ſtrength given natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to one Medicine to do all things: hence is the great variety of Medicines, that every diſeaſe hath its peculiar remedy. And this variety had been in vain given by God, if all diſeaſes could be cured by one ſimple univerſal Medicine. And all Apothecaries would break, and Phyſitians might burn their books, if that Medicine were ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Hence it ſollows, that this ſoundation of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is unſhaken. <hi>That which is beſides Nature, is to be taken away, and that which is according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is to be preſerved, like things are preſerved by their like, and contraries are cured by their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> The Chymiſts themſelves admit of theſe general Indications. And therefore they give a force of ſtrengthening the natural Balſom to their univerſal Medicine, and to comfort and conſume diſeaſes breeding impurities, and ſo of curing all diſeaſes: but they have not proved that one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine ſhould do both.</p>
               <p>The Author of the Natural Phyſick of the round Viſion and Cabaliſtical Chymiſtry in his Book called, <hi>The open Cheſt of the moſt Artificial Secret,</hi> hath ſo many abſurdities as words. And the learned Chymiſts approve it not, whether he worte it in earneſt or in jeſt. There is ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Book called, <hi>The New Knowledg of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Medicine,</hi> ſet out by a Profeſſor of Phyſick of <hi>Fribury</hi> in <hi>Briſgoy</hi> called <hi>Wolfang.</hi> And though he promiſeth much concerning this Medicine, no
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:171520:72"/>man yet can hear what he hath done, though many enquire. Therefore the Chymiſts do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſh and hope for this univerſal Mendicine then enjoy it.</p>
               <p>In the matter of Phyſick they differ little from the Galeniſts; firſt in finding out the faculties of Medicines, they go another way, which they call by <hi>Signatures,</hi> and ſay that the Plants that repreſent Animals, or any parts of them, or are like any way, are good to ſtrengthen thoſe parts or to expel diſeaſes. To theſe they add the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Planets, and the Plants that are ſubject to ſuch a Dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are dedicated to thoſe parts as are under thoſe Planets. Under <hi>Saturn</hi> they place Plants that are <hi>rough and unpleaſant, black, ſwarthy pale, and Lead-coloured, thin and dry ſlalks, binding, ſtinking, mooriſh: theſe have an Antipathy with the Plants of the Sun, and are dedicated to the Spleen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Plants of <hi>Jupiter</hi> are <hi>oyly, pleaſant in ſcent and taſt, with red and skie-colour'd flowers, theſe belong to the Liver; as Balſom, Oyl, Clove-giliflowers, Bettony, Avens, Lillies, Centaury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Plants of <hi>Mars</hi> are <hi>reddiſh, ſharp, and rough, Corroſives, and ſuch as grow in dry places, as Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, Carduus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe under the <hi>Sun</hi> are <hi>ſweet in ſcent and taſt, yellow flower'd, or gold-Colour'd, that grow in the South Sun;</hi> to theſe they refer <hi>Wine, Saffron, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, Oranges, Balm, Roſemary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under <hi>Venus</hi> are Plants <hi>of a ſweet taſt, and an amurous ſcent, with a white flower, as the Dog-ſtone; Plants, all Lillies, and Lilly Convals, Daffodils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſay <hi>Mercury</hi> governs <hi>Plants of divers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours that grow in ſandy grounds, bare Cods, have a ſubtile ſcent, as Pellitory, Chamomil, Columbines,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:171520:72"/>Beans, Daſies, three-leaved Graſs, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Moon</hi> governs the Plants with <hi>ſoft leaves thick and full of juyce, as Gourds, Cowcumbers, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, Musk melons, Pompions, Lettice, Garlick, Onions, Leeks, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The modern Chymiſts from theſe made Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine peculiar to every humor and part; they thought that theſe have great relation to the blood, as <hi>Gilliflowers, Roſes, Piony, Bugloſs, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Violets, and therefore ſerve for Sanguification.</hi> And that Bugloſs and Borage purge the blood from melancholy, Fumitory from choler, the Peach-leaves from flegm, and all Plants that are like blood do ſtop blood, as <hi>Tormentil, Snake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed, Herb Robert, with the red Root, red Roſes, the Bloodſtone, red Coral.</hi> They ſay that theſe ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing are like to choler, and do purge it, as <hi>Rhubarb, Agrimony, yellow Mirobalans.</hi> They are ſuch as are <hi>black or duskie,</hi> are like melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſuch as are bitter or aſtringent, as <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pody, black Hellebore, Senna, Aſarabacca.</hi> Theſe are proper to evacuate flegm, as <hi>wild Cowcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Mercury, Arage,</hi> all theſe are under the Moon, and belong to the ſtomach and brain, and purge them, are good againſt flegm, and the moiſt ſcab, and the like.</p>
               <p>As to the parts of the body: the brain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is governed by the Moon, hath relation to the Medicines under its Dominion, and againſt all diſeaſes of the brain, <hi>Moonwort, Silver, and Pearl</hi> are good. Finally, they aſcribe proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines to every part of the body, either from the ſignature or colour, or from the Dominion of the Planet over the part.</p>
               <p>They ſay the Herbs with pointed Leaves, as <hi>Carduus Mariae and Benedictus, Eryngus, Juniper,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:171520:73"/>&amp;c.</hi> are good againſt pricking pains. That plants that have knotty roots, are good againſt tumors and puſtles. They which are perſorated, or are like an axe or ſaw, or any thing that wil wound are good againſt wounds. That plants that have ſlimy and glutinous juyce, and have gums and roſin heal wounds: thoſe that are ſpotted and ſcaly leaved, cure the ſcab and all defilements of the skin. Thoſe like Serpents and other vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous beaſts, are good againſt their bitings and ſtings. <note place="margin">Queſtot. lib. deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnat. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternis.

               </p>
               <p>All theſe are not to be rejected, nor do I think with <hi>Libavius</hi> that it is by chance that things anſwer to their external forms. For experience witneſſeth the external figures are the ſigns of the internal vertue. And let <hi>Signature</hi> have its place among the reſt, for finding out the faculties of Medicines and diſeaſes. The Galeniſts have long approved that Medicines are proper to ſuch parts as they reſemble, as Piony and Poppy are good for the head and brain, but we muſt not truſt only ſignature, though it is the chiefeſt, and let experience be yeilded unto.</p>
               <p>Nor is it to be contemned, that every plant is under a peculiar Planet, becauſe Heaven (by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) acteth not upon things below only by heat and light, but by an occult influence. But this was not the Chymiſts Invention, but the Aſtrologers of old.</p>

The Devils in old time ſhewed their worſhippers by what words, ſigns and images they would be worſhipped and called upon, and ſo from a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant they are of power. Hence it happens that they which read ſuch words and conjurations, though they underſtand them not, yet do raiſe the Devil: <hi>Martin Delrio</hi> hath an example of this.

It is an ancient trick to grave a Dragon upon a Jaſper-ſtone, and put it in a ring. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> propounds many Characters out of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> in his Book of Archidox Magick, and in that of occult Philoſophy, he prefers two before all Sigus and Characters: the one in which the word <hi>Adonai</hi> is written in a figure, the other in which the word <hi>Tetragrammaton</hi> is written (as if it were the Name of God) he writes theſe are good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Devils and diſeaſes from Incantation; nor

               <p>But neither <hi>Paracelſus</hi> nor others that allow Power to <hi>Characters</hi> and <hi>Seals</hi> agree in giving a cauſe of the effects they produce. Some bring their ſtrength from Heaven,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Differ.</hi> 101</note> as the Concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor out of that of <hi>Ptolomy. The countenance of ſublunary things is ſubject to the heavenly counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, ſo that the coeleſtial Scorpion governs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior;</hi> which being granted, what doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern a Scorpion graven upon a Jewel, nor are they under the ſame kind. Others ſay there is a force inſtilled into them from Heaven, and the Stars. Others ſay that Individuals beginning to be under a determinate conſtellation, receive an admirable faculty to work or ſuffer, beſides what they have from their ſpecies. But a Jewel or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal doth not then begin to be when it is graven, but it was before. Others think otherwiſe, but none could yet bring any probabilities for the vertue of them, much leſs have any of them po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to get favor to men, or knowledg, wit, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, or love of a King, or Victory in War and Law, or good ſucceſs in hunting, or merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, or make faithful friends, or raiſe a man to honor, and the like.</p>
               <p>Two things are in Seals, the <hi>Matter</hi> and the <hi>Character,</hi> to neither of which can this force be aſcribed: not to the <hi>Matter</hi> which is from nature, nor hath it that ſtrength as they confeſs, and if it had, it would have it without a figure or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, as a Loadſtone under what figure ſoever, hath pover to draw iron without a Character. The <hi>Characters</hi> are from the Artificer, and from
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:171520:74"/>the Idea in his mind, which cannot work upon external things, therefore cannot have force from themſelves or from the Artificer; of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they are nothing but figures, but a figure is not active being but a quality of the quantity: nor do artificial things act upon natural, and change them, or affect them, as being ſuch, but they act upon them as they have natural matter, and on the contrary, natural things do not alter nor affect articificial, as ſuch, but as they are of a natural matter. Therefore images or names <hi>graven upon Matter,</hi> can do nothing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Nor can they take their ſtrength from Heaven, for if the matter of which they are made, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any ſtrength from Heaven, it may receive it as well without Characters; nor have they yet proved the contrary: therefore if any effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be found in theſe, it muſt be aſcribed either to imagination, which is of great force, or to the Devil, who by ſecret ſigns is invited by ſuch cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, by way of compact made of old with his worſhippers. For theſe came from the Gentils that were ſubject to Superſtition and Idolatry, and the Devils gave theſe Characters from a bargain either explicite or implicite, by which only they prevail from the Devil who made a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him that firſt learned them.</p>
               <p>Nor is it ſufficient what they ſay, that ſuch things are without the invocation of the Devil, or adjuration, or any unlawful way, but work naturally. For firſt they muſt prove that there is ſuch a peculiar vertue in ſuch Seals, which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals and Gemms have not of themſelves; for though it be not an explicite bargain or conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet it may be implicite, and the Devil
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:171520:75"/>knows the dice he gave his worſhippers before. Therefore the Primitive Church ordered the converted Gentils to abſtain from things conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the Devil.

               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſaith therefore that the patient be forſaken and lie without help, when remedies that work by nature cannot cure him being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted? We ſay firſt that it is falſe, that diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes brought by Magick, cannot be cured by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural means, of which we have many examples. For ſuch diſeaſes are often produced by natural means, and when ſuch things are removed as cauſes, they are cured by natural means, by a ſtrong faith in God. So Medicines that purge melancholy have been given with good ſucceſs to ſuch as have been poſſeſſed of the Devil. See in <hi>Rulands</hi> Centuries, for a melancholy humor is the Devils bath. Alſo by purges, and vomits, hair, needles, wood, iron, and other ſtrange things have been voided, that have cauſed ſuſpicion of Witchcraft: and the patients have recovered. Therefore we muſt never flie to the help of the Devil, becauſe it is deceitful, he cures the body to get the ſoul, and any diſeaſe or death it ſelf, ought to be more deſired, then health from the Devil.</p>
               <p>To this is like the magnetick cure by amulets, for many things work naturally by a vertual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract as <hi>Galen</hi> confeſſeth,

               <p>Some are more moderate and ſay all our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are not poyſon, but have much impurity that hinders their profitable force; and they who give whole medicines do like them that boyl the birds in their neſts, and eat Oyſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels and all. But Alchymy is that only Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which the malignant quality given by God for ſin is taken away; Let the impurities which hinder the force of the vital ſpirit, and break it, be caſt away. Here they inveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the vulgar way of preparing of medicines, and firſt they argue that there are too many ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in a medicine: becauſe one diſeaſe hath but one nature, and requires but one proper remedy. And as ſimple diet is beſt for a man, and variety hurteth, much more doth a compound medicine offend a ſick perſon.</p>
               <p>And to contract all in a word that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadg againſt Galeniſts, they diſallow the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of cure and making medicines, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that borh Purgers and Altererers are poyſonous, corroſives, <hi>impure, unpleaſant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efficacious, confuſed and ſtrange.</hi> Hence they
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:171520:76"/>caſt off the ordinary Diſpenſatory; they inveigh againſt forreign medicines and ſay they are Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian fooleries, and inventions of Apothecaries.</p>
               <p>Then they carp at the Galeniſts, becauſe they uſe not Stones, Metals or Minerals, or very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, being as they ſay the beſt of medicines, and vegetables are not ſufficient to root out diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; becauſe they have a fugitive ſpirit and make not a fixed Balſom, and preſerve not from putrefaction, as Metals do which laſt long; therfore the Galeniſts ſend patients to the Spaw waters, which have all their power from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of minerals and metals. Therefore the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts having a better phyſical matter and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prepared, they ſay they cure diſeaſes by the Galeniſts uncurable.</p>
               <p>Theſe accuſations are not a few, nor weak, and if they could clearly prove them the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines we uſe were to be totally rejected: But it is not hard to vindicate the Galeniſts, for what they ſay of poyſon put into creatures by the curſe is without reaſon, and is refuted Chap 16. and the Chymiſts themſelves think otherwiſe as <hi>Rulandus</hi> obſerves.

               </p>
               <p>Moreover it is fooliſh to ſay that all purges have the nature of poyſon, we grant ſome that are vehement are adverſe in nature to our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: But what is that againſt the Galeniſts or for the Chymiſts? They have their Cauteries and Sections, and Vomits that are adverſe, and yet they are not alwaies to be rejected. So if the ſtrong purgers moleſt in ſome way the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, yet the profit they bring by purging bad humors is greater. Albeit the hurt they bring is from the want of right preparation and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:171520:77"/>
               <p>But no Chymical preparation or ſeparation takes away the poyſon from a venemous body, or can make it a good Medicine: nor do purgers, prepare them how you pleaſe, lay aſide their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wholly. Nor have the Chymiſts given any purge that hath not ſome way diſturbed the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, therefore purging extracts are to be given with as much caution as others.</p>
               <p>What they bring againſt the vulgar compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Medicines, is of little weight; ſo that the way of compoſition uſed, is not to be aboliſhed, and their arguments are moſt from the Galeniſts that allow them not: and all Doctors diſallow the crowding in of divers Simples without a cauſe, and they think it raſhneſs to uſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds when Simples will do, and that it is bad to put many Simples of the ſame faculty into one Compound.</p>
               <p>But many may be mixed when diſeaſes are complicate, both in the affects and the cauſes, when Medicines are to be directed by many ends which cannot be done by one ſimple Medicine, for one ſimple Medicine can ſcarce be found that hath ſo many faculties joyned together, as the Doctor hath ends propounded.</p>
               <p>Therefore let Chymical preparations have their due praiſe and place, and the Vulgar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations theirs. But it is the part of an idle and too curious perſon to prepare all things Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and when a Conſerve or a Pouder wil ſerve to give an Oyl or a Spirit. Nor is the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a Chymical medicine for its ſmal doſe ſufficient, becauſe it cauſeth no diſguſt, for ſo you may commend poyſons. This is the error of many, who to pleaſe the palate only, give the Extract of Scammony, Cambugia, or a little
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:171520:77"/>Pouder, but great in operation, but conſider not whether it hit the diſeaſe, and evacuate the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant humor. To conclude, it is the part of a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Phyſitian ſomtimes to uſe Chymical, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times whole Medicines, according to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the diſeaſes, place and time.</p>
               <p>They alſo are not wiſe, who reject exotick or outlandiſh Medicines, for neither wine nor ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that grow from home, being uſed every day, are enemies: <hi>Every Land doth not produce every thing.</hi> Therefore there is commerce that one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould ſupply the other. It is true that the Galeniſts ſay if home-bred Phyſick, it were in vain to get forraign, but if not, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why exotick Medicines may not be uſed.</p>
               <p>We reject not wholly Phyſick made of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and Metals,

The ancient Phyſitians gave them inwardly as well as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, as Steel, Sulphur vive, ſcales of Braſs, burnt Braſs, and the like. Therefore we may better uſe them Chymically prepared. Niter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared called <hi>Sal Prunellae,</hi> is uſed happily againſt Quinzies and Feavers.

               <p>It may be objected that Metals are enemies to Nature, but we muſt labor to take away that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity by Chymiſtry, you may ſee this in Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:171520:78"/>its venom by Chymical preparation. Yet we commend not them that include all Medicines in a few Metals, as if God had made Vegetables in vain. It is known to all how Medicines made of Vegetables and Animals, refreſh both the ſound and the ſick with their pleaſant taſt and ſcent, and it is not yet proved that Minerals can do the ſame.</p>
               <p>Hence the queſtion is eaſily decided, whether Chymical or Galenical Medicines are beſt? To ſpeak my thoughts, they both have their places and praiſes, but if you ask which is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the one ſimply cannot be preferred before the other. For though the Chymiſts have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain prerogative, yet indeed they are not better then Galeniſts, but the Medicines excel in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of preparation, nor are they ſimply to be preferred for this cauſe, for I ſaid both have their place, and it is the part of an unexperienced man never to deſire to uſe Chymical medicines, or not to uſe whole medicines, but all Extracts or Eſſences For ſome medicines ſo diſperſe their vertue through the whole body, that if their parts ſhould be ſeparated, they would partly or whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looſe it. Others have their ſtrength in other parts, where conſider in what part it is. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſe whole medicines, when the force deſired is in the whole body, and vaniſheth when it is diſſolved: But uſe diſſolved or ſeparated medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, when the ſtrength of them is divers, and comes from divers parts; or when the force of the medicine may be brought into a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity by taking away what is unprofitable.</p>
               <p>Here obſerve, that which way ſoever Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Mercury are prepared, they never wil be ſo good and ſafe, as Caſſia, Manna, Tamarinds,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:171520:78"/>Senna, Rhubarb, and the like, and from one grain of them, more hurt may come, then from an ounce of ordinary Phyſick. And which way ſoever they are prepared, they are alwaies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted vehement medicines. Though ſome brag of ſecrets and ſingular preparations, they have not yet diſcovered them. Therefore let the Chymiſts prove that the volatile purging Spirit that paſſeth through the whole body, remains ſuch in Antimony and Mercury after preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo that it may be ſo benigne and familiar to our Nature, as Caſſia and Tamarinds, and the reſt. This they will ſcarce do, for that Spirit is eaſier to the fixed or thrown away, then to be qualified as to looſe its nature.

               </p>
               <p>Therefore a wiſe Phyſitian muſt uſe ſomtimes this, and ſomtimes that, as the nature of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and circumſtances requires, as Pouders, Decoctions, Infuſions or Extracts, Minerals, and domeſtick and forraign Medicines. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, when you will ſtrengthen and bind, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Roſes doth that which a Spirit, or Water, or Salt of the ſame cannot do: on the other ſide, the ſtrength of medicines is greater in Chymiſtry, as in Oyls and Spirits. For the Phyſical part is ſeparated from what is unprofitable that hinders its operation, and ſo it is given pure. Therfore we conclude, that Chymical medicines conſidered ſimply, are nobler of themſelves, becauſe purer and more active, but they are not alwaies and every where to be preferred before Galenical.</p>
               <p>Nor is the objection againſt Chymical medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines of force, when they ſay, that what ariſeth
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:171520:79"/>from the ſolution of the mixture, is not ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and the Chymiſts while they diſſolve the mixture,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de ſimpt. med. fac. c.</hi> 14.</note> deſtroy the eſſence. For <hi>Galen</hi> ſhews that all medicines, though to ſenſe ſimple, yet are in nature compounds, and ſo have divers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the parts, and afford divers uſes for divers things. Moreover, the ſolution is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies into the firſt Elements, as we ſhewed, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Chymiſts diſſolve ſuch bodies by art, and diſſolve diſſimilary bodies into ſimilary parts, they are ſo far from deſtroying the ſtrength of the medicine, that they rather ſeparate them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all heterogeneal mixture. Nor doth the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt tranſmute the thing, but makes one thing of another by the power of nature. As that which is extracted from Rhubarb in the Spirit of Wine or other liquor, is the ſame in number and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with that in which the force of purging de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends in Rhubarb being whole And ſo we grant that as he that gives butter, doth not give all the milk, ſo he that gives the Extract of Rhubarb, gives it not all, but onely that part in which the force of purging lieth. Therefore medicines made by ſolution, are not of the ſame ſpecies with the whole, but are of the ſame kind with the parts of the whole, from which they were made.</p>
               <p>Let us conclude thus, he that will be a true Phyſitian needs not only medicines to cure as an Emperick, but he muſt follow method and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications, otherwiſe he will do more hurt then good, for the abuſe of the beſt thing is the worſt.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:171520:79"/>think themſelves wiſer then others, and neglect all vulgar remedies approved by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and uſe only Chymical medicines lately invented, and not well approved, and ſo get a fame. And to teach ſome Galeniſts that being ignorant of Chymiſtry, yet to ſeem inſeriour to none, give dangerous Chymical medicines, not knowing their ſtrength and preparation. The Chymiſts offend in this at this time, who being ignorant of all other parts of Phyſick, yet having a little skil in Chymical operations, contemn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Phyſitians, and proclame their own perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and ſo with the Cobler, they go beyond their laſt.</p>
               <p>Let us now diſcuſs the Controverſie, whether we muſt uſe contraries or things like, for curing diſeaſes? It is an old Axiom, <hi>Contraries are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by contraries:</hi> whence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> defines Phyſick <hi>to be addition and ſubſtraction, that is, to add things defective by the like; and to ſubſtract or take away what aboundeth,</hi> and happens to the body beſides nature by the contrary. For curing is a motion from a diſeaſe to health,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ariſt.</hi> 5. <hi>metaphyſ.</hi>
                  </note> and motion is reſpect of a contrary.</p>
               <p>The modern Chymiſts ſay that like cures like, and when there may be a twofold ſimilitude, with the diſeaſe and with nature, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand both, becauſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nature is the Phyſitianeſs of diſeaſes,</hi> and remedies are in vain when ſhe reſiſteth. Hence <hi>Galen</hi> ſhews that the vital indication is to be preferred before all, therefore things are to be given which are like and familiar with nature. Then they think that things alike are to be given in reſpect of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe and its cauſes, for purges attract vitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors by the ſimilitude of the whole ſubſtance,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:171520:80"/>and Alterers muſt be like to the part to which they are applied, and there are proper medicines for every part, ſome for the heart, others for the brain and liver. Then they ſay that diſeaſes ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from Salt, are cured by Salts, and thoſe from Sulphur by Sulphur. But this Controverſie is rather in words then things. Firſt, they agree in this, that alwaies there is a care to be had of the ſtrength, and it muſt be preſerved by its like: nor doth the other Axiom oppoſe this, namely, <hi>That contraries are cured by contraries.</hi> For here we muſt diſtinguiſh between a vital and a curing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication in ſpecies. And when <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, <hi>Contraries are cured by contraries,</hi> he ſpeaks not of a vital Indication, but of taking away what is preternatural, and muſt be only ment ſo. Hence it is that the patient deſires contrary things to the diſeaſe, as when he thirſteth, he deſires drink which is the cure of thirſt; for it is not the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe that deſires remedies, as the thirſt doth not require drink, but the thirſty: and ſo by this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule, whatſoever is beſides nature, is to be taken away.</p>
               <p>Nor do the Galeniſts deny that medicines are to be choſen, which are familiar and proper to the part affected, which familiarity is in ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and an occult Sympathy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſuppoſe the Diſpute is not of the contrariety of Alterers, nor is there any Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian ſo ſimple, that will give a hot remedy as hot againſt a hot diſeaſe as ſo, or thinks that a dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed body as ſuch, is to be more dried. For expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience is againſt them, and ſenſe, not onely in men but beaſts, who in great heat require to be cooled, and in cold to be warmed. Therefore the Axiom of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> remains unſhaken,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:171520:80"/>which <hi>Galen</hi> confirms,
<note place="margin">

                  <hi>That the Remedies of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries are contrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though the Galeniſts contend among themſelves about this, and ſome would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it, yet hitherto they have not.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Controverſie remains about the cauſes, whether remedies muſt be like or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto them? If by contrary, we underſtand whatſoever is effectively ſo, or that can produce an effect contrary to the preternatural affect; I ſuppoſe the Chymiſts will not be againſt us, for they give their medicines for that end, namely, that the cauſe and the diſeaſe may be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and not increaſed. Nor do any of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that of <hi>Hippocrates,
<note place="margin">3. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 22.</note> That diſeaſes from fulneſs muſt be cured by evacuation.</hi> The queſtion then is, How ought medicines to be againſt the cauſes of diſeaſes, according to internal ſtrength, and nature, and ſubſtance? Here lies the great wheel of the Controverſie, for the Paracelſian Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts refer diſeaſes or the cauſes of them to their Principles, and cal ſome Sulphurous, ſome Salt, and ſome Mercurial, the Sulphurous they ſay are to be cured by Sulphur, the Salt by Salt, and the Mercurial by Mercury; if Sulphur be on fire, it muſt be quenched, and in this they admit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties, but only by ſulphurous medicines, and ſo they think of ſalt and tartarous diſeaſes, as the ſtone which is to be cured by Tartar. Hence the ſtones in Cattel and other Creatures, are good to break it, and the Jew-ſtone in the ſtone of the kidnies &amp; bladder, and roots of Butchers-broom, Smallage, Marſhmallows, and ſo they ſay that the diſeaſe alwaies denotes the remedy.</p>
               <p>In this the Galeniſts and Paracelſians ſeem to differ, let us labor to reconcile them. And firſt
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:171520:81"/>moſt Galeniſts to allow that Purges do attract foul humors by a familiarity of ſubſtance, which doth not overthrow that old Axiom, that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are cured by contraries. For they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies effectively contrary, for the diſeaſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wales taken away by contraries mediately or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, by it ſelf or by accident; and though Rhubarb attract choler by the likeneſs of its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, yet it cauſeth choler to be purged, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writes well,

                     <hi>De priſc. mat. med. c.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.</note> and keep them burning. <hi>Quercetan</hi> proves this by gun-powder, for though Salt-peeter and Sulphur are eaſily ſet on fire, yet both have a ſharp Spirit, with which if you touch the pouder, it will flame no more. Therefore in one reſpect the like cures the like, and in another the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the contrary; for between humors and things that diſſolve humors, there is a familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But in reſpect of the taking away of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe and the cauſes, contraries are required.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the conſent and diſſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Chymiſts and the Galeniſts. He that conſiders this wiſely,

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:171520:81"/>Chymiſtry, and he is admirable that knows what is Divine in Diſeaſes, in Medicines and Nature, and finds out the fountains of actions, all which may be done by Chymiſtry; but he that cleaves onely to the firſt qualities in things, cannot come to this.</hi> Other things that reſpect the conſtitution, faculties, and actions, the cauſes and differences of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Symptoms, the Signs, Prognoſticks, and Method of Curing, may be found in <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and their Interpreters.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Appendix, we ſuppoſe what <hi>Libavius</hi> wrote at large, and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guin</hi> in ſhort, and what we mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the fifth Book of Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. That though Chymical Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations and Medicines are there added, yet here I will plainly lay down as in a Table, the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:171520:82"/>whole Nature of Chymiſtry, and its Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the places alleadged, and add ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhments. This I ſhall do without calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niating any, or detracting from them.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>For two may differ in opinion,</l>
                  <l>And ſtill in friendſhip keep communion.</l>
               </q>
               <p>All Sciences and Arts, as they are found, ought to ſtand upon ſome Principles, that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be given of things done in them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is rather an ignorance then a ſcience, yet Chymiſtry the moſt noble &amp; uſeful Art, hath few things fortified with reaſon, and brought from certain Principles; for there are many proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Forms of Operation, of which few teach the cauſes and Principles, ſo that it ſeems to be an Art without an Art. But as Phyſick ſo Chymiſtry is wholly ſubject to the natural Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and muſt follow the Laws of Nature, in working, ſo that there may be a mutual conſent between them both.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Chapter of this Tractate, there is the Subject, Definition, and a twofold end of Chymiſtry. But laying aſide the former end, we ſhall here ſpeak onely of the Conſtitution of Chymiſtry, as it ſerves a Phyſitian, and helps him to good Medicines; and we ſhal propound ſome things in Operations which may ſerve for the laſt end.</p>
               <p>A Chymiſt to obtain his end, muſt have ſome means or Mediums, which are Chymical opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and inſtruments by which he worketh. Of which we ſhall ſpeak in order.</p>
               <p>As for the inſtruments, the chief are fire or heat, the Menſtruum, air and water; but that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:171520:82"/>may be applied to the patients, there are required furnaces, glaſſes, and many other veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. We ſpake elſwhere of furnaces, glaſſes, and other veſſels, and of luting,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Inſt. l.</hi> 1. <hi>part.</hi> 3. <hi>ſec.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 11.12.14.</note> and we added inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for other operations. And Chap. 2. we ſpake of fire and heat.</p>
               <p>The Menſtrua are whatſoever things ſerve for ſolution, extraction and ſeparation of bodies: and this name is commonly given to liquors, which caſt upon bodies, have an actual force to diſſolve or extract ſomthing out, as common Water, diſtilled Waters, Dew, Spirit of Wine, Turpentine, diſtilled Vinegar, and things diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in it, Spirit of Salt, Niter, Vitriol, Aqua for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, and Regia, of which in the place of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions cited.</p>
               <p>We may bring all theſe liquors into three heads, ſome are watery, ſome have Salt, others are oyly, bodies are not diſſolved, but by their proper diſſolvers that anſwer to their nature. The watery bodies are like water, and are diſſolved and extracted by watery Menſtrua, Sugar and Salt, which melt in water, diſſolve ſalt bodies, and no other. Things ſpiritual are diſſolved by Spirits, ſalt things by ſalt Spirits, and extracted by oyl and fats. Metals and Stones by Aqua for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, and Regia, and the like liquors. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Salt no Metal is diſſolved, becauſe all Metals are of a ſalt nature; therefore the firſt melting muſt needs be by Salts. Mercury diſſolveth gold, not ſo much by corroſion as by ſimilitude, or an occult quality. And Aqua fortis, though it be very corroſive, diſſolves not Roſin, Wax or Pitch, but they are diſſolved in oyls and fats. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore get the proper Menſtruum for diſſolving of very thing.</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:171520:83"/>
               <p>Some underſtand by the word Menſtruum, not only liquors, but other dry bodies, which diſſolve things, as Salt, Niter, Sulphur, which being added to Metals or Stones, and reſolved in a fire of reverberation, inſinuate into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies applied, and diſſolve them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chymiſts muſt have air which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth two waies, namely as it is moiſt, and hath wateriſh vapors, and as it is cold; as it is moiſt, it ſerves a Chymiſt, when it is mixed with things by nature dry, and makes them of a moiſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence; this is when air gets into Salts in moiſt places, and makes them melt. And in ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillations the moiſt air cauſeth the Spirits that are by nature dry, and come forth like clouds, to turn moiſt, as in Oyl of Sal Gem made by a bell, in Spirit of Salt and Vitriol, and the like.</p>
               <p>Alſo air ſerveth in reſpect of its coldneſs, for cold by accident and binding of Homogeneal bodies, doth congregate; therefore Salts ſooner grow together in water, then in heat.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, water is an inſtrument of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, not only as a Menſtruum to diſſolve and waſh, but to mix it ſelf with dry Spirits in a moiſt air.</p>
               <p>I ſhould add Earth, and the like, but for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, therefore in making Spirit of Salt and Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Poters Earth, Bole, and ſealed Earth, are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. In diſtilling ſome Oyls, the pouder of Bricks, Sand and Aſhes are uſed. Firſt, that the body to be diſtilled, may be as fine and ſmall as may be, and be better healed. Secondly, leaſt the glaſs ſhould be broken by things that eaſily diſſolve (as Niter) another body is added to make it diſſolve gently. Alſo the Chymiſts uſe other inſtruments for ſome operations, as Oyl of Tartar, to preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:171520:83"/>Pearl and Coral being diſſolved, and other for others, but I doubt whether theſe may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the former inſtruments.</p>
               <p>As for Chymical operations, they are diverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided, and I let every man uſe his own way: I divide them into a Diacriſis, and Syncriſis, and Immutation.</p>
               <p>Diacriſis is, <hi>when the Fabrick of the Body is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and that which was one, is divided.</hi> This is done three waies 1. When the impure or ſtrange bodies are ſeparated. 2. When the body is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into Homogeneal parts. 3. When it is diſſolved into Heterogeneal parts. In which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations let the Chymiſts take this propoſition, let all things be made as pure, and ſubtile, and efficacious as may be.</p>
               <p>To the Diacriſis belong <hi>Purification, Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sublimation, Reſolution, Extraction, the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the Tincture, Putrefaction, and Diſtillation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Purification</hi> is by waſhing, and often diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and coagulating, and filtration,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Inſtit. c.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 10.</note> of which elſwhere. To this belongs drying or exſiccation, which is by evaporation and exhalation, alſo burning, as when the ſulphurous parts and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which are not required to ſtay, do flie away, and that remains which you deſire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calcination</hi> is either by actual or potential fire, that is, by a liquor that hath power to corrode and diſſolve, as <hi>diſtilled Vinegar, Spirit of Salt,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Inſtit. c.</hi> 6.</note> Niter, or Vitriol,</hi> of which Chap. 6. Alſo Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, Minerals, and Stones, and other hard things are calcined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sublimation</hi> is, to ſeparate impurities, and to bring bodies to the leaſt Atomes. By all theſe waies the body is diſſolved into Homogeneal parts, and that which is diſſolved is homogeneal.</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:171520:84"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſolution</hi> is, when a body is diſſolved into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Heterogeneal parts. In this Diacriſis note, that the properties are in the whole, or in the parts, therefore when you deſire the force which is in the whole, you need not this operation, but when you need the force that is in a part that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the whole, obſerve in what part it is. So Conſerve of Roſes is good in a Dyſentery, not Spirit of Roſes. To this belong Tinctures and Eſſences,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Inſt. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>part.</hi> 3. <hi>ſect.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> of which elſwhere.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Tinctures</hi> obſerve, that there is no true Tincture which doth not remain after the Menſtruum, is abſtracted. If many Tinctures were examined by this rule, they were not true, but that colour is from the mixture of the Menſtruum with the body diſſolved.</p>
               <p>Diacriſis is alſo by <hi>Putrefaction,</hi> which tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to a kind of ſeparation, as parts by nature ſomwhat ſeparated, may be better ſeparated by art,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Instit. loc. cit. c.</hi> 7.</note> therefore as we ſhewed, it is often uſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſtillation.</p>
               <p>To this head, we refer all diſtillations by deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, by the ſide, by aſcent in a moiſt bath, dry, or vaporous,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Instit. loc. cit. ſect.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> in aſhes, ſand, or open fire.</p>
               <p>The ſecond kind of Chymical operation, is the Syncriſis, when divers things ſeparated, are joyned together. This is done firſt by precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when the body diſſolved in ſome Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum, and diſperſed by a liquor, is again ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the liquor, and goes to the body, and unites it ſelf. And he that conſiders all precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Instit loc. cit.</hi> 3.13.</note> may obſerve that precipitation is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally made when any thing is caſt in for ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or infuſed, by whoſe force the liquor diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or that which in the liquor, is the cauſe or ſolution, is ſeparated from the body diſſolved.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:171520:84"/>
               <p>To this may <hi>Reduction</hi> be referred, by which a body brought to a pouder or liquor, or the like, is reſtored to its firſt form: yet reduction is not in all bodies that are diſſolved by their Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum, or put on another ſhape by the mixture of other things. For though theſe may be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their Menſtruum, yet they are brought only into the form of a pouder, not into their firſt form. This is done beſt by <hi>Precipitation. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi> is uſed in Metals, which being brought into divers forms, may ſtill be reduced. Now reduction is by taking away the Menſtruum, and that which brought another form into the body. The Salt of Tartar is an uſual inſtrument for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, not that it is contrary to all corroſives, and breaks their force, but becauſe it is a friend to all Salts, and therefore attracts them, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites them to it ſelf by its likeneſs, and ſo the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being freed from the Salt of the Menſtruum that diſſolved it, is reſtored to its own nature.</p>
               <p>Metals when melted or mixed with diſſolving waters, are filthy, ſeparated from their Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um by precipitation, ſometimes warm water is ſufficient to ſeparate a Metal from its Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum.</p>
               <p>To Syncriſis alſo belongs coagulation and concretion, of which in my Inſtitutions.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>part</hi> 3. <hi>ſec.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To this you may refer <hi>Digeſtion</hi> and <hi>Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which is for this end, that the liquid parts which are not ſufficiently mixed, may be united by the leaſt bodies, of which elſwhere.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To this belongs <hi>Cohobation,</hi> or an often diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the liquor caſt into the matter let in the veſſel; this is, that what was not ſeparated in the firſt diſtillation, may be drawn out in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third, yet ſometimes that the matter
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:171520:85"/>which is volatile in the liquor, may be joyned to the fixed.</p>
               <p>The third kind of Chymical operation, is <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation,</hi> as when we bring a new manner of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance upon a thing. To this belongs firſt the changing of a dry thing into a liquid form, this operation is called <hi>Deliquium,</hi> of which before. For though the moiſt air is then joyned to that body,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Loc. cit. c.</hi> 4.</note> yet nothing is added that gives it peculiar ſtrength, but the conſiſtence is only changed.</p>
               <p>To this belongs that operation whereby ſolid bodies are made drinkable, where we ſhall que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether gold may be made potable? Of which hereafter. Secondly, to this belongs the contrary operation, as when a ſolid body is made of a liquid, as Precipitate of Quickſilver, of which before.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>part</hi> 3. <hi>ſec.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 18.</note> Thirdly, <hi>Fixation</hi> or <hi>Volatilſation</hi> belong to this, as when no part of the thing is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, nor other thing added, and a fixed body is made of a volatile, and a volatile of a fixed. It is called fixed or volatile, in reſpect of the fire or heat, the thing in its own nature is ſuch, but the heat or fire makes it manifeſt, for that is fixed which endureth the firſt, volatile is that which flies away by heat. This is done by the addition of an Homogeneal body: for fixed Salts may be made volatile by digeſtion, and alſo ſublimed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vitrification</hi> or turning into glaſs, is the end of tranſmutation of natural bodies, after they are melted by the ſtrongeſt fire.</p>
               <p>We have mentioned the operations which the Chymiſts uſe as means to obtain their end. As for Chymical works, they are under two heads, according to the twofold nature of Chymical bodies Some are Homogeneal, ſome are Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneal, but there are no words to expreſs it:
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:171520:85"/>Some cal the firſt work an <hi>Extract,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Libavius.</note> the laſt a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtery.</hi> And in the ſpecial explaining of theſe, there are divers appellations, as <hi>Ens, Eſſence, Quinteſſence, the Secret, Magiſterium, Panacaea,</hi> and the like, but theſe are not uſed alike of all: but let us not fall out about words but things.</p>
               <p>There are three ſorts of Chymical works. The firſt is when nothing is ſeparated from the whole but a thing is changed and made more uſeful, and a new manner of ſubſtance or quality is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, they call this a <hi>Magiſtery,</hi> but it may be called <hi>unchanged</hi> or <hi>imperſect.</hi> The ſecond ſort is when that which is ſeparated from the whole, or extracted, which may be called a <hi>Secret,</hi> or <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated body,</hi> or an <hi>Extract</hi> by the name of the ſpecies. The third is that which holds the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds: for the Chymiſt doth not only prepare Simples, but Compounds, ſome as Elixirs Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, and the like.</p>
               <p>To the firſt kind belong firſt things that of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid become liquid as Oyls made by a deliquium, the making of which is in my Inſtitutions.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib</hi> 5. <hi>par.</hi> 3. <hi>ſec.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 14.</note> As the Oyl or Liquor of Tartar, and other Salts, which are not properly Oyls, but whole bodies impregnated with their ſalt Menſtruum; and therefore melt in the moiſt air: to this is drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable gold referred, and other potable Metals.</p>
               <p>The Chymiſts diſpute whether Metals may be reduced into a liquid form of themſelves? I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the liquidity is from the Menſtruum mixed, becauſe all Metals are of a dry nature, and they that think otherwiſe, let them ſhew that there is any moiſture in them, if not, it is not in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of art, that theſe dry parts of Metals, and their dry fumes, ſhould be turned into water. And though the Chymiſts add nothing, yet if it
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:171520:86"/>be left in the moiſt air, it gets into it, as appears by Vitriol calcined.</p>
               <p>Of this kind are, the diſſolvings of Pearl, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Crabs-eyes. White vomiting Vitriol and pouder, and chalks of Metals. The golden Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of Antimony, Crocus of Mars, and other Metals, which is made only of the ſubſtance of Metal reſolved. But here we underſtand things plainly Homogeneal, and from which nothing is ſeparated, but only a new kind of ſubſtance is induced.</p>
               <p>The ſecond kind of Chymical works is called the <hi>Secret</hi> or <hi>ſeparated Body,</hi> where the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is not preſented, but a part To this belong <hi>purified Bodies, burnt and calcined, all the chalks of combuſtible things, and Salts</hi> drawn from them. Alſo <hi>Extracts</hi> and <hi>Tinctures,</hi> or <hi>Eſſences.</hi> Alſo <hi>Diſtillations,</hi> as Waters, Spirits, Oyls properly or improperly ſo called, <hi>Sublimates</hi> and <hi>Flowers,</hi> when the whole body is not ſublimed, but part of it remains.</p>
               <p>But it is abſurd to make Extracts or Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences or Oyls of all things, eſpecially of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances plainly ſubtile or Homogeneal. There is an example in Pepper whoſe corns in a cold ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, when the liver is hot are good, becauſe they heat the ſtomach, and hurt not the liver, but the Extract or Oyl of Pepper is not good, becauſe it goes preſently to the liver, and hurts it.</p>
               <p>The third kind of Chymical work is of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 5 <hi>par.</hi> 3. <hi>ſec.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> to this belongs the <hi>Elixir,</hi> of which in my Inſtitutes.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the differences in general of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical operations, of which there is great variety according to the variety of bodies, as Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Animals, Minerals and Metals, for every
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:171520:86"/>thing is not made of every thing, but one thing of another: therefore the Chymiſts muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what may be made of every thing. For Vegetables to this belong whole Plants and their parts: as of herbs, ſhurbs, trees, leaves, flowers, ſeeds, &amp;c. of theſe are made depurated Juyces, Spirits, Oyls, Extracts, and Tinctures, and Salts, you may ad juyces to theſe in the preparing that they may laſt better, as Wine, or a little Spirit of Wine.</p>
               <p>We ſhewed in our Inſtitutes the way of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſimple and compound Waters and Spirits.
<note place="margin">Lib. proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Citato.</note> Theſe are made of green or dry Plants, green Plants we diſtil in Balneo, or if they be juycy, we make juyces, and clarifie them in the embers, and diſtil them; if they be leſs juycy, we add water, and diſtil them in a ſtill, or add water, and preſs out the juyce, and then diſtil it. But when we make Spirits, fermentation is made firſt.</p>
               <p>A queſtion may ariſe whether Oyls and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits differ in Eſſence? This we leave to every mans judgment.</p>
               <p>Groſſer Oyls made by burning of bodies, are of woods and barks, as of Box, Guajacum: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in theſe the oyly ſubſtance cleaves ſo cloſe to the wood, that if you boyl it, it cannot be drawn out.</p>
               <p>Then obſerve in Extracts, that every Simple will not afford an Extract, for little is extracted from things that have ſpiritual parts, and that have ſpiritual and oyly Waters, as Roſemary, Mints; but they whoſe ſtrength is in a ſlimy juyce and are not volatile, have more extract, as Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Calamus Aromaticus, Carduus, and the like.</p>
               <p>We ſaid that Salts are made of Plants, but ſome
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:171520:87"/>do it only to delight the eyes,

                     <hi>Inſt. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>ſ</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> and not increaſe the ſtrength. They make Salts in Cryſtals, and ſomtimes they pour Aqua fortis upon Salts vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly prepared as in making Tartar vitriolate this is reprehended; from Salts of Plants there is alſo a Spirit as we ſhewed to be made.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C</hi> 5.</note> Things called Faeculae belong to ſeparations made of Plants.</p>
               <p>Of Drops, and Roſins, and Gums are made Spirits and Oyls, and an Extract of Scammony called a Roſin, and it is pure Scammony ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all its impurity, as the Extract or Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of Aloes Alſo there is flour of Benzoin ſublimed.</p>
               <p>From Tartar there is a cream of Cryſtal, a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, Spirit and Oyl, Salt, &amp; the Secret or great Magiſtery is made the ſame way, as the Magiſtery only inſtead of ſpirit of Wine we uſe diſtil'd Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar. Moreover the cream and Cryſtal of Tartar is not a pure Salt, becauſe it diſſolves not in cold water, and if it be diſtilled in a Retort it affords oyl alſo. That called oyl of Tartar is not its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Oyl, but its Salt diſſolved by Deliquium.</p>
               <p>From Coral a Magiſtery is made, and many talk of a tincture of Coral: but if it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the beſt Chymiſts dare not promiſe it to be true, but it is the Solution or Magiſtery of Coral mixed with ſome Menſtruum.</p>
               <p>Chymiſts work alſo upon Animals and their parts, as Blood, Fleſh, Horns, Bones, Stones, Pearls, Perch ſtones, Crabs eyes, Galls.</p>
               <p>Of Honey is made a Water or Spirit, of Wax there is made an Oyl, and from Butter. From fats of Beaſts an Oyl is diſtilled which is hotter and drier then they. Of Urine is made Salt;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:171520:87"/>from Blood only a fixed and volatile ſalt, water and oyl: but they are not ſafely given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by reaſon of their ſtink, nor out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, for other things may ſupply. Some make Mummy of blood which is nothing but that fibrous part of the blood, and the beginning of fleſh ſeparated from the ſerous and dried in the Sun. Alſo Mummy is made of Mans fleſh. And a Water is diſtilled from hearts of Beaſts, and from Horns. There is Phyſick made alſo, of Mans Skull and other bones burnt: or a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, Oyl, or Volatile Salt; by a Retort.</p>
               <p>From Stones bred in mans body there is made a Salt and Oyl; and a Magiſtery from Pearl, Crabs eyes, Perch ſtones; but I doubt that the ſpirit of Pearl is mixed with a Menſtrual Salt, therefore I ſuppoſe that Pearl vulgarly prepared is wholſomer in many diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>As for Minerals and Metals they are objects of Chymiſtry. Of Amber there is an oyl. Of Sea ſalt or other, a Spirit or Oyl. Of Niter is made Sal Prunellae.</p>
               <p>From Sulphur there is flour by ſublimation, of this flour there is a Tincture and Balſom of Sulphur with ſpirit of Turpentine and Wine, and of the ſame flour is <hi>Lac Sulphuris</hi> made.</p>
               <p>The Chymiſts talk much of the oyl of Talk, but of it ſelf it is not made into a liquor, but being calcined with a ſtrong fire or with Niter and Vinegar ſprinkled upon it, the volatile Salt in the Vinegar unites it ſelf with the caclined Talcum, and then melts, he that can ſhew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter let him.</p>
               <p>From Gemms are made Magiſteries, then Tinctures, but if any coloured Liquor be from Gems, it is rather the diſſolving of the Gemms
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:171520:88"/>then an extracted Tincture.</p>
               <p>Things made of Minerals and other metals are not ſo eaſie, we ſhall ſpeak a little of ſome of them.</p>
               <p>From Vitriol by diſtillation is firſt drawn a Flegm and Spirit. Spirit of Vitriol is thus made. Take <hi>Vitriol as much as you pleaſe, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine it yellow, pour enough of the ſpirit of Wine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it to make it like a Paſte, diſtil it, rectifie the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit when it is extracted; thence make a ſalt of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol by pouring hot water upon the Caput mortuum or Lees.</hi> I ſee no cauſe why this may not be counted a Salt. Some labour to make a green ſpirit of Vitriol.</p>
               <p>Antimony firſt may be calcined, and then it is called Crocus metallorum from its Saffron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour. You may make flour of the ſame by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination. There is alſo a Stone or Glaſs made of Antimony. Some make a Tincture, a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, and a Butter. Antimony is made Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, and loſeth its purging quality by the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of fixed Salts: this is done when Antimony is often melted with Niter, for Niter gives ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of ſubſtance to Antimony, and makes it of volatile fixed, this is ſo hard as <hi>Crollius</hi> writes wittily, the art of Fire cannot take away the force of cauſing Vomit from Antimony, though many have attempted it: becauſe they abhor that quality of vomiting, nor hath any Chymiſt this preparation, though many brag of it; for if the vomiting quality be gone, the purging quality muſt go with it: Nor is it an argument becauſe ſome vomit not after Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is taken by them, for that is from the ſtrength of the ſtomach, or the diſpoſition of the humors to be evacuated.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:171520:88"/>
               <p>Let us ſpeak a little of the Phyſical uſe of Quick-ſilver, this only ſhews that one thing keeping the ſame internal form and nature, may have divers external forms; it may be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſublimed, precipitated, poudered, made to flour-like ſilver, into glaſs to be like a metal, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated and changed, and many waies tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in divers liquors: yet ſo that it eaſily comes to its old nature, flies away, and is fixed, nor is there any heterogeneal part that may be ſeparated, of it are made firſt many precipitates, of which there are many deſcriptions, ſome call it Turbith, others diſtinguiſh it. Alſo there is <hi>Mercurius vitae, Crollius</hi> cal'd it the flour of the butter of Antimony, but wrong. Of the ſame is made a Bezoard Mineral, then there is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Sublimate, and a <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> the ſecret of Coral is a kind of Sublimate. Alſo there is a Silver flour made of Mercury,
<note place="margin">In Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyph. her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metica.</note> and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, oyls and ſpirits: <hi>Libavius</hi> hath deſcribed the Mercury waters.</p>
               <p>As for other metals ſome are fixed, others not, the fixed are Gold (which alone loſeth nothing though long in the fire) and Silver, which becauſe it is more fixed then others, is counted fixed as Gold, we ſhewed in our Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the calcination of metals by fire and a Menſtruum.

               <p>From Lead is made <hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi> if this be put into a Retort and diſtilled, there is made a liquor called oyl of Lead. Of Tinn is made a Cryſtal and oyl or liquor. Of Steel is made <hi>Crocus martis</hi> of which there are divers deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and tinctures. If Vitriol be diſſolved in water and ſpirit of Vitriol, it is after coagulated into Vitriol. Vitriol is made of Copper, called
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:171520:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Vitriolum veneris.</hi> Of Silver is made a Tincture.</p>
               <p>There are many diſputes of drinkable Gold, but I ſuppoſe that what is ſould for potable Gold is only the Magiſteries mentioned and Gold diſſolved into the ſmalleſt parts and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a menſtruum, divers menſtruums are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about; the force of diſſolving in all which, lies in the Salt. And Gold is to be brought to that paſs, that it may be diſſolved in ſpirit of Wine or other liquor, which may be done by divers Menſtruums. And in all the end is that the body of Gold being thick and compact may be reſolved into very fine atomes, that being taken in it may with more eaſe exerciſe its force upon the body. Therefore firſt they uſe ſtronger, then weaker menſtruums, and if any menſtruum be an enemy to nature, it is ſeparated by the fire or by waſhing. But then the Gold doth not of it ſelf diſſolve into a liquor, but by reaſon of Salt that is mixed with it from the menſtruum.</p>
